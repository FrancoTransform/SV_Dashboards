These leaders are expected to deliver clarity, momentum, and stability—while suddenly navigating medical decisions, emotional strain, and physical disruption. Most employers offer insurance and clinical support, but they lack real-time, experienced, executive-centric coaching to help executives process the diagnosis, communicate with stakeholders, and balance their dual responsibilities to their health and their company.

Without targeted support, executives often withdraw, make reactive decisions, or disappear from the business when their leadership is most needed. This creates ripple effects across teams and priorities, leading to unnecessary leaves, stalled initiatives, and cultural instability. GTMFlow closes this gap by delivering executive-grade coaching that helps leaders develop a plan, communicate confidently, and stay engaged—so they can protect their health and business continuity.","Joelle Kaufman, Founder & CEO

We address those problems by engaging patients early - before they are diagnosed - and supporting the critical initial steps in their journey. 

Our entry point for patient engagement addresses the suffering that patients endure trying to get timely and accurate answers when they suspect they may have cancer. Then, for those who do have a positive diagnosis, we help address the challenge they face in finding the best oncology team for their specific condition and ensure their treatment plan reflects best practice among complex and rapidly evolving treatment options.

We met during Walt’s interview process and immediately clicked. We realized then - and have continued to learn - that we have very different but complementary backgrounds and styles. We’re also at a similar moment in our careers, eager to put what we’ve learned previously to work taking a big swing at a complex problem in healthcare - and one that we both have a personal connection with.",No. We launch next week!,"During our initial phase of growth, we’ll be targeting regionally-based employers and regional health plans, both commercial and Medicare, with membership that is concentrated geographically. Our core value prop to employers and payers is around cost savings. According to the Business Group on Heath, 86% of employers report that oncology is among their top 3 cost drivers, the highest of any condition. Costs are spiraling, projected at 9% CAGR through 2030. Early incidence of cancer among working-age individuals has grown 31% over the past decade.

Although the core motion is B2B2C, member engagement is critical and thus we have a strong consumer focus as well. Individuals face long waits for diagnostic services and the frustration inherent in navigating a fragmented healthcare environment, all while dealing with the anxiety brought on by the suspicion of cancer. Our ideal profile in this area rides trends in consumer behavior that show individuals more engaged in their own (or loved ones’) healthcare decision making, especially for serious concerns such as cancer. These folks have high expectations for a service experience that is set by other industries (e.g. hospitality, travel, retail), which legacy healthcare often fails to meet. When dissatisfied, they are proactive in seeking consumer-friendly alternatives, primarily through online research, and are even willing to pay out-of-pocket (e.g., second opinion, full-body MRI, at-home testing).","$5.5B with initial focus on breast cancer, expanding over time to $16B as we cover additional cancer types.","When it comes to diagnostic services specifically, we’re competing primarily against legacy health systems and providers. There has been relatively little innovation in care delivery for this phase of the patient journey, and it remains fragmented and lacking patient focus. 

More broadly, we “compete” with four types of digital health companies in cancer care: screening & early detection; care navigation; centers of excellence; and second opinion. All suffer from low rates of patient engagement. What they get wrong, we believe, is the time in the patient journey at which they engage. Screening & early detection companies have shortcomings similar to many preventive health solutions in that many individuals,  in the absence of an acute problem, aren’t paying attention. Other solutions, which often rely on claims triggers or other health plan data, engage too late. Once a patient is diagnosed, they typically are rushed to establish care with an oncology team and get a treatment plan in place. Care navigation, COE, and second opinion programs usually don’t get to patients until they have a diagnosis and, at which point, they’ve often made critical decisions regarding their provider or their treatment that are difficult to revisit. 

While these other solutions are competitors in some sense, we believe there is opportunity to partner with them. For example, having engaged a patient during the diagnostic phase, we can then help them evaluate options in a COE program their employer offers.","Our initial model includes two sources of revenue, connected to two stages of the patient journey:

Stage 1: For patients with a suspicion of cancer, we charge a $400 concierge fee for a same- or next-day consultation with our oncology-trained primary care physicians, immediate access to diagnostic services, assistance in logistics (such as records collection). The concierge fee may be cash pay for individual consumers or part of the covered benefit with plans and employers.

Stage 2: For patients with a confirmed diagnosis, we charge payers a value-based case rate – currently estimated at $8,000 – for a) expedited staging and further diagnostics based on Dana-Farber proprietary diagnostic pathways; b) guidance in selecting a high-value oncologist; c) a “first opinion” treatment recommendation based on Dana-Farber treatment pathways, and d) ongoing support/advocacy from our clinical team.

This case rate is based on projected average per patient savings of >$24,000 from 1) appropriate utilization of diagnostic services, avoiding unnecessary/excessive testing post-biopsy; 2) avoiding higher cost HOPD sites through Defiant's network of independent diagnostic providers; 3) avoiding less effective or excessive treatment through adherence to Dana-Farber treatment pathways; and 4) when appropriate, avoiding higher cost NCI, AMC, or hospital settings for treatment by guiding patients to high-quality community practices.",Preparing to launch in our initial geo (eastern Massachusetts) next week,"Though we’re not live yet, we have an LOI in place with Evernorth for a pilot in 1-2 markets.","Current pricing structure is explained above. The intent with our Evernorth pilot is to gather cost savings data.

Walt’s background is in operations and Gina’s is in product. We have both partnered extensively with sales, but it is obviously different to be in the driver's seat! We need help to make our positioning, messaging, and sales process as tight as possible.","The company’s initial focus was around supportive care and symptom management for patients in active treatment. We got feedback that our solution wasn’t sufficiently differentiated from others in the space and that the TAM was likely not big enough. We also learned that engagement for solutions focused on the treatment stage was often low, primarily because it came too late and oncologists were very much in the driver’s seat by that point. Looking upstream, we saw an opportunity stemming from the numerous pain points that patients face during the peri-diagnostic phase. This insight, combined with an understanding of the impact of patient decisions during this phase on outcomes and costs, led us to pivot our attention there.","We met Robby through our fundraising process, and he suggested we apply.",N/A,TRUE,,4/25/2025 22:46:38,j9jszuwigjrtrhfk6j9jsztd7b79ex9u,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The largest driver of engagement is the manager, but 55% of managers are burnt out and ill-equipped to coach their teams.

Mandala solves this by embedding leadership coaching directly into employees’ daily flow of work, helping them prioritize better, give clearer feedback, and build emotional resilience—all via Slack and Teams.","Tarun Galagali, CEO & Founder (https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarun-galagali-b1a45a20/)","Our tech is led by a Stanford-trained engineer (fractional CTO / advisor) who built Slack-integrated AI systems at scale.

Most decisions are made collaboratively between HR and executive leadership. Once initial pilot data is collected, we align with stakeholders on post-pilot success metrics to inform full rollout and budget approval.","Our go-to-market strategy is directly informed by both bottom-up customer feedback and top-down market demand. After delivering $635K in live coaching to companies like Google, Microsoft, and Flatiron Health, we consistently heard the same request: “Can our entire team get access to this?” That insight catalyzed our pivot to a product-led model—embedding coaching directly into Slack and Teams so that every employee, not just managers, could benefit.

Our early pilot customers validated this shift. In onboarding interviews with COOs, CPOs, and Heads of Talent, we heard a consistent desire for scalable, behavior-focused tools that don't require scheduling workshops or logging into another platform. We’ve structured our AI Coach to meet those needs by delivering weekly prompts, real-time nudges, and measurable insights inside the tools teams already use.

These direct insights are reinforced by broader market signals: Gallup reports 69% of U.S. employees are disengaged, and HBR cites 55% of managers as burned out. Companies are actively looking for scalable, embedded solutions to support performance, reduce attrition, and improve employee well-being.

On the technical side, we’re seeking ongoing support around AI ethics, data governance, and security architecture—particularly as we move into licensing anonymized insights to companies. We want to be proactive in building trust and defensibility in how we handle employee data.","After two years of delivering high-touch, live coaching programs to managers at companies like Google and Microsoft, we asked a simple question at the end of each engagement: What’s still missing? The answer was clear: “My team needs this, not just me.”

That moment reshaped our direction. It made us realize that coaching had been incorrectly monopolized by executives and managers, and that individual contributors—who drive most of the day-to-day experience and culture—were largely unsupported. We realized the only way to scale behavior change across entire organizations was to meet employees where they already are: inside Slack and Teams.

That insight led us to build Mandala’s AI Coach: a personalized, neuroscience-based tool designed for every employee—not just those with titles.

The Head of Total Rewards is typically the primary decision maker, with participation from benefits managers, People Ops, and the company’s benefits broker. Because the benefit is free, the sales cycle is often quite short (a few weeks) and nearly always launched off-cycle from other benefits. Larger companies with more formal procurement processes can take longer, and sometimes companies do insist on aligning with their open enrollment schedule.","Traction and customer feedback. We launched as many company partnerships in the first 2 months of the mortgage product as in 2 years of the liquidity product.

Toothsome,2023,Toothsome a direct-care benefits platform that allows employers fund and coordinate high-value dental care.,https://toothsome.io,https://docsend.com/view/sabwiemhswa4d24y,https://vimeo.com/1050320428?share=copy,"Dental insurance is outdated and insufficient. Annual coverage caps have barely changed in 40+ years, leaving patients without support for common major procedures. This poor coverage leads to poor utilization of paid benefits. More than $50 billion in dental benefits go unused each year, paid for by US employers. When patients can't afford treatment, they defer care, and deferred care leads to worse health outcomes, including costly emergencies. The result? An estimated $45 billion in productivity loss annually from dental-related absenteeism, and a rise in downstream medical spend due to preventable emergency room and hospital admissions. Toothsome addresses this by giving employers and employees a smarter alternative: a fintech-powered platform combined with a curated center-of-excellence network that coordinates and funds advanced dental care. Initially designed to work alongside insurance, Toothsome helps employers cover what plans miss—while establishing the infrastructure to evolve into a full-stack alternative as adoption scales.","Dr. Shouvik Ponnusamy (Founder & CEO)
https://www.linkedin.com/in/shouvik-ponnusamy",We have two full-time engineers and one part-time designer building the product in-house. The platform is entirely built by our team.,"Team of 3: 2 in engineering, 1 part-time in design. The founder leads product, growth, and operations, with the aid of key advisors.",No co-founder. Founder is solo and supported by a lean engineering team.,"Yes, our D2C marketplace for high-value dental services has been live for 6+ months. The employer-facing platform is in pilot.","We are targeting mid-sized fully insured employers—especially those not yet offering dental benefits or looking to enhance what they have. Their biggest pain point is the poor ROI on legacy dental benefit spend. Most of premium dollars spent go unused, employees delay care, end some even end up in ERs with preventable oral infections, shifting the cost burden to the medical plans in a way that’s entirely avoidable. Toothsome helps them eliminate waste and fund care that reduces absenteeism, downstream spend, and employee frustration.","The U.S. private dental benefits market is $107B annually. Our initial serviceable market is the $60B that flows through fully insured employers. With a target of reaching just 5% market penetration and a 6% take rate, our near-term opportunity exceeds $95M in annual revenue potential.","Key competitors include Bento, Kleer, Level, and Quip.
Bento mimics self-funded dental insurance but keeps traditional insurance structures—annual maxes, exclusions, and administrative complexity.
Kleer offers in-office dental memberships and a basic employer marketplace, but requires individual dentists to sell directly to employers—a model that has historically failed.
Level tried to modernize dental benefits with prepaid cards but lacked provider network coordination or care routing.
Quip is entirely D2C and limited to preventive and cosmetic care, with no infrastructure for employer benefits or clinical integration.
Toothsome combines a fintech funding model with a COE provider network and is built for employer scale and clinical impact.",We are pre-revenue. We plan to generate revenue through a transaction-based take rate (7-10%) on care delivered through our platform.,"60+ dentists onboarded, 400+ patient users, 90 appointment requests, and $125,000 in GMV of treatment completed","We’ve processed 90+ patient requests and have 60+ participating providers. Our current focus is on expanding our network of high-quality providers across dental specialties in Texas. We've built early partnerships with leading dental education organizations such as the Academy of General Dentistry and the American Board of Oral Implantology, giving us unique access to top-tier clinicians. We are intentionally building supply-side liquidity first to ensure a delightful patient experience when we initiate employer benefit partnerships.","We do not currently have paying customers. However, we’ve validated strong consumer demand for a patient-facing platform to search and compare high-value dental procedures—an insight that reflects broader employee needs and supports our shift toward employer distribution.","As we begin employer outreach, we are positioning Toothsome as a supplemental or ""bolt-on"" dental benefit, which simplifies adoption and shortens decision cycles compared to traditional health benefits sales. Because our MVP is operationally light, it can be implemented virtually immediately. We expect buying decisions to involve HR and benefits leaders, with brokers often playing a key role in implementation and pilot structuring.","Strong market signals come from both patients and providers. ADA research shows that for nearly 70% of Americans, paying cash would have cost less than the combination of insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, demonstrating that the value proposition of traditional dental insurance is rapidly deteriorating. Simultaneously, 1 in 4 dentists exited at least one insurance network in 2024 due to poor reimbursement and administrative friction. These shifts signal a broad breakdown in the legacy dental insurance model. While employers may not yet realize how much value is lost in unused benefits, they are increasingly aware of employee dissatisfaction and network shrinkage. 
Direct contracting has already proven successful in other verticals like musculoskeletal care, oncology, and imaging, where employers have achieved 20–40% cost savings. We’re not here to replace dental insurance overnight, we start by filling its biggest gaps. But long-term, we believe direct care funding models like Toothsome will become the new standard. Toothsome is applying the same model to dentistry, capturing those benefits through a direct-pay, outcomes-oriented platform.","We have raised $165,000 in angel funding to date. No institutional investors yet. Investors are primarily dentists who are users on the platform. We are now actively raising a $500K seed round to expand employer pilots and enhance our infrastructure.",Approximately 6 months with current burn.,TRUE,"Employer pilot execution, introduction to forward-thinking HR/broker partners, and refinement of our employer benefit offering.

We quickly realized that while the demand was clear, D2C acquisition was too expensive and hard to scale. The turning point came when we helped facilitate a bundled treatment for a patient at a reasonable cash price. This particular patient was an employee of a major insurance company, and insisted that her benefits would cover the treatment. Upon learning that the procedure was not covered, the patient walked away from the care she needed. That moment revealed a critical insight: even highly insured employees misunderstand coverage, and cost still remains a barrier, despite an employer’s  investment and importance placed on health and wellness. The employer, not the patient, ultimately controls access and funding. That insight led us to pivot toward a B2B2C model built around employer-driven care navigation and benefit funding.","Recommendation from Norm Volsky, as well as introductory call with Colin Tobias.",Norm Volsky,TRUE,samy@toothsome.io,5/2/2025 4:19:13,ksgb2rko7xa20seeqxiu4sksgb2rhlxt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sunny Health solves this with an AI-powered concierge that understands your health plan, finds the right providers, checks eligibility in real-time, and books appointments, all through a simple embeddable chat. No apps. No hold times. No guesswork.

This matters because the current healthcare navigation isn’t just frustrating, it’s costly. It leads to worse outcomes for patients and higher spend for employers and insurers. Our solution increases benefits utilization, improves time-to-care by 60%, and reduces avoidable claims, unlocking ROI for all stakeholders.","Bilal Farooqui, CEO

He is a unicorn in terms of his ability to practice clinical medicine while also embedding deep in Github working with Nik and I to build the best consumer product.

Nik is a full-stack AI native engineer whose core skill is shipping really high quality, secure, production grade code at lightning speed. I met Nik through my network and originally was planning to write some code together while I looked for a full time CTO. He ended up being incredible in the role and before long I realized I had a co-founder.",Our concierge is available for direct to consumer access at sunnyhealth.ai. We have been live for 3 weeks.,"Our target customers are self-funded employers and payers. Their biggest pain point is providing high quality, low cost access to care for their employees. There is currently no cost-effective healthcare concierge that is able to solve this problem in real time optimizing for quality, cost, and availability at the same time.",180m commercial lives + 34m MA lives x $2-5 per member per month = ~$5-13 billion ARR,"Our competitors include Transcarent, Accolade, Included Health, and Rightway. They offer care navigation through call centers, apps, or human-led chat, all of which are slow, expensive, and hard to scale.

What they get wrong is the assumption that more humans equals better care. In reality, most navigation questions (e.g., ""Is this doctor in-network?"" or ""Can I book an urgent care visit near me today?"") don’t require clinical judgment, they require speed, clarity, and integration with benefits and provider data.

We’re building an AI-native agent that answers member questions instantly and acts on their behalf, verifying coverage, finding the right provider, and booking the appointment, all in one conversation. No apps to download, no hold music, no re-explaining your benefits.

Where competitors struggle to scale efficiently and deliver consistent outcomes, we deliver 10x faster access at a fraction of the cost, and drive measurable ROI for employers and payers through better benefit utilization and fewer unnecessary ER visits.",PE/PM and PM/PM paid by employers and payers,Our consumer alpha version is live and we are in conversations to start our first employer pilot with a 70 person employer in California,"We do not have a sales pipeline yet, just 1 potential pilot customer",$2 PE/PM,We do not have a scaleable sales motion yet,"Our go-to-market strategy is validated by both market signals and direct customer research.

Payer and employer pain points: Rising administrative costs and low benefits utilization are driving demand for AI solutions that simplify care navigation. 24% of ER visits are avoidable, and up to 40% of members don't know how to use their health plan. Our interviews with benefits leaders at mid-size employers and TPAs confirm that they are actively seeking solutions that reduce waste, boost member experience, and work with existing plan infrastructure.

Enterprise buyer interest: We’ve had conversations with a large national payer, a top-tier PEO, and multiple regional TPAs. Early feedback highlights that our zero-integration AI agent, which understands member benefits and books in-network care, is a key differentiator compared to high-friction tools or call centers.

Market timing: The rise of embedded AI agents, new CMS transparency rules, and layoffs at traditional navigation vendors (e.g., Accolade, Included Health) signal a shift toward lower-cost, software-first solutions. Employers are asking for navigation that “just works” without training or app downloads.","$50k - Austen Allred - CEO, Lambda School & GauntletAI

$50k - Zaid Farooqui - Director of Product, Cloudflare and Bilal's former co-founder",6 months,TRUE,A well-oiled sales and go to market motion with pilot customers and a repeatable sales process,"Our greatest barriers to success are:

Payer and Employer Sales Cycles
Selling into payers, PEOs, and benefits platforms involves long, relationship-driven sales cycles with multiple stakeholders. We mitigate this through strategic pilots, warm intros, and by proving immediate ROI via utilization and cost-savings metrics.

Integration Complexity
Integrating with provider directories, benefit structures, and claims data can be technically complex and vary by customer. We've built modular, API-first infrastructure and leverage existing standards (like MRFs and FHIR) to accelerate deployments.

Trust and Compliance
Handling PHI and influencing care decisions requires deep trust. We're HIPAA-compliant, deploy AI with direct observability in real-time, and ensure human review. Trust is also built through enterprise design: zero training, no downloads, and seamless EDI or portal-based workflows.

Competitive Noise
The digital health space is crowded. But most tools focus narrowly (just scheduling, or just benefits), or fail to personalize at the plan and provider level. Sunny wins by offering an all-in-one AI concierge that knows your network, your plan, and your preferences, and delivers measurable outcomes.","While we bring deep expertise in healthcare product development, AI, and go-to-market strategy, we are currently seeking additional support in the following areas:

Network access to payer and employer decision-makers (particularly heads of benefits, medical directors, and digital health strategy teams) to accelerate enterprise pilots and commercial partnerships.

Support navigating healthcare procurement cycles and contracting structures, especially with large insurers and PEOs.

Strategic guidance on health economics and actuarial modeling to quantify ROI for payers and employers more effectively.

Expertise in scaling healthcare AI agents safely and compliantly, particularly as we deepen PHI use and move into autonomous workflows (e.g., claims navigation, eligibility verification).

We’re looking for partners who can help us go further, faster, especially where credibility, relationships, and nuanced understanding of enterprise healthcare make the difference.","One major piece of feedback we received early on was that while patients loved our AI-powered healthcare navigation experience, employers and payers were skeptical of “yet another point solution.” They didn’t want to add another vendor, they wanted deeper integration with existing systems and measurable ROI on care access, not just a better interface.

This pushed us to pivot from a standalone AI concierge to an embeddable infrastructure layer that could plug directly into payer portals, PEOs, and employer benefits platforms. 

This change dramatically improved traction with enterprise customers. It taught us that product excellence isn’t enough, you have to meet stakeholders where they are, solve a business problem they own, and plug into their workflows to drive adoption.",During fundraising conversation with Robby Peters at SemperVirens,Robby Peters,TRUE,bilal@sunnyhealth.ai,5/6/2025 2:20:44,y5t6luu3pojljonx3j48ny5t6luu3j93,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We've been running our first US tapering cohort since June 2024.,"Currently, people who want to stop their antidepressants - expanding to other psych medication classes, and eventually to people who want to get off hard-to-stop medications, in general.

PCPs deprescribing: Not trained on it, don't have the time.
Psychiatrists: Expensive, limited, largely believe medications are needed long-term due to pharma-driven education

Volta Health,2023,"Volta bridges health tech, insurtech, and edtech, leveraging AI and data intelligence to automate regulated insurance and healthcare processes for colleges and universities.",https://www.volta.health,https://volta.docsend.com/view/6ekwuzax35pwa5xr,https://volta.docsend.com/v/kkwtb/volta-dashboard,"- Our flagship service addresses a critical compliance requirement for universities. Educational institutions mandate health insurance coverage for their student populations—sometimes due to state regulations (e.g., Massachusetts) and invariably as a risk mitigation, reputation protecting measure. Consider a student who fractures their leg during an intramural game—no matter how comprehensive a university’s health center is, that student will likely need hospital care. If the student lacks adequate insurance, the situation becomes a major headache for the student and university, leading to potential reputational damage, legal liability from parents, retention risks due to medical debt, and even financial liability for hospitals covering uninsured students.Since the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the majority of students—up to 90% in some cases—are covered under their parents’ insurance. Thus, these students can waive out of the university-sponsored health insurance plan (SHIP), but the waiver process is complex. Schools impose specific requirements such as deductible limits, HMO vs. PPO preferences, and restrictions on out-of-state plans, making verification of an entire student body a logistical nightmare.
    - *Universities*
        - Educational institutions face two options for insurance verification: building an in-house verification team or outsourcing to brokerage firms. While some institutions with substantial resources handle this internally (e.g., Yale, Emory), most—even including prestigious institutions like Stanford and Brown—outsource this function at significant expense. Volta reduces these costs by millions of dollars annually. (See below for calculus).
    - *Brokers*
        - Brokerage firms provide two primary services to universities: procurement of official SHIP plan (generating a 5% commission on premium value) and administration of enrollment/waiver processes of said plan (increasing commissions to 15%). Using two New York institutions as examples, NYU's $80 million yearly premium and Columbia's $125 million yearly premium generate $8 million and $12.5 million respectively in commissions for waiver and enrollment administration alone. By partnering with Volta, brokers maintain their commission structure while outsourcing the labor-intensive verification process to us at a fraction of the cost, substantially increasing their profit margins.
    - Payers
        - Insurance providers face considerable challenges in the current ecosystem. Brokers' annual renegotiation practices create unpredictable revenue streams and prevent insurers from recouping implementation costs. Volta enables insurers to bypass brokerage intermediaries by directly addressing universities' most significant pain point—the waiver and enrollment process. While plan selection is relatively straightforward for institutions, it is the managing of verification for thousands of students and dependents presents considerable operational challenges that our platform efficiently resolves.
- Insurance Billing
    - University health centers function as de facto clinics, offering essential medical services to students. Yet, unlike traditional healthcare providers, they *do not bill third party insurance*. Instead, universities absorb these healthcare costs as operational expenses. Volta changes this dynamic. We introduce the capability to bill insurance providers for eligible services, enabling health centers to achieve financial sustainability without the added burden of figuring out coding, billing, etc. This approach allows institutions to, at minimum, break even on health center operations and potentially generate revenue that can offset student health fees, making healthcare more accessible and sustainable for students.","CEO: Tsikata Apenyo, MD MBA (linkedin.com/in/apenyo)

Bringing her on has been one of the best decisions—we balance each other well and move faster and smarter because of it.","In January 2024, we launched a pilot program with Ohio State University and have since worked with Venbrook Brokerage, Emory, and University of Mount Saint Vincent.",Educational institutions now face a significant challenge: they must continue to fulfill regulatory requirements while simultaneously reducing overhead costs. Our core offerings automate previously manual compliance processes in addition to turning historical cost drivers into revenue generating centers.,https://volta.docsend.com/view/32inmrs47jpmmy9r,"Brokerage firms typically offer universities two core services: securing the official Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP), which yields them a 5% commission on the plan’s total premium, and managing the enrollment and waiver process, which can boost their commission to 15%. Take, for example, two major New York institutions—NYU and Columbia. With annual SHIP premiums of $80 million and $125 million respectively, these firms earn $8 million and $12.5 million solely from administering waivers and enrollments. Yet despite these substantial fees, brokers have not only inflated costs across the industry but also consistently underperformed, frequently failing to capture the full potential premium value for their clients.","We operate under a bifurcated business model designed to align closely with the value we deliver to payers and brokers.

The first component is commission-based: we earn a 5% commission on the total premium of each health plan. Additionally, we charge a 10% commission on any premiums generated above the institution’s historical enrollment baseline—essentially incentivizing and rewarding increased student engagement and plan adoption.

The second part of our model is SaaS-based. We charge a recurring software fee for access to our suite of non-insurance features, which includes personalized care navigation, mental health integrations, and digital tools that streamline administrative workflows.

In the coming months, we’ll be adding a third revenue stream as we finalize the rollout of our RCM services.

The combination of targeted advice from experienced industry leaders, real-time feedback from corporate decision-makers, and access to a proven channel partnership playbook is incredibly compelling. We’re especially excited about the chance to pitch to innovation councils at large distributors — that kind of exposure and feedback could be a game-changer for us at this stage.

The opportunity to learn directly from experts through focused webinars, prep sessions, and one-on-one advisory meetings would help us avoid common pitfalls and scale smarter. And the long-term value of joining a strong alumni network and tapping into vetted resources and tools is something we don’t take lightly. We’re looking for partners who get what we’re building — and this program looks like it was built for companies like ours.","We’re building in a space — student health and wellness — that has historically been underserved by technology, so there’s an educational component to our outreach. We’re not just selling a solution; we’re often helping stakeholders reimagine what’s possible.

Additionally, like many early-stage companies, we’re balancing limited resources while trying to move quickly — expanding our product, onboarding new partners, and scaling implementation without compromising quality.","As we scale Volta, there are a few areas where we’d benefit from deeper knowledge and support. First, we’re looking to strengthen our channel partnerships — we’ve seen early interest from brokers, carriers and strategic distributors, but the payer space is relationship based and as such continually evolving one's network is critical.

We’re also looking to expand our network within large healthcare organizations and benefits platforms that serve the higher ed markets. While we’ve made strong inroads with universities, connecting more directly with decision-makers at larger distribution channels would accelerate our growth.","One of the most important learnings we had early in building Volta was realizing that what we started with was a “nice-to-have.” Our initial product resonated with students, but it didn’t solve a core pain point for the stakeholders who controlled the budgets. The turning point came when we stepped back and started following the money — mapping out who was spending, who was making decisions, and where the real friction existed. That led us to uncover a part of the student health ecosystem that was deeply fragmented, outdated, and full of inefficiencies no one had solved for.

That insight pushed us to pivot from a student-facing wellness app to a platform that directly reduces administrative burden, integrates with existing systems, and helps schools meet growing compliance, engagement, and care coordination demands.","Referral via SemperVirens Senior Associate, Raquel Scott","SemperVirens Senior Associate, Raquel Scott",TRUE,tsikata@volta.health,5/9/2025 20:28:20,5azkz8bdw3mg3nsxhhaw5azkzs8bhggk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beacon is the first platform to underwrite recruiter quality—turning trust into a measurable, actionable, and insurable layer.","Two initial revenue streams: (1) SaaS subscriptions for recruiters ($5K–$10K+ ARR), and (2) referral fees (20% of placement + 2-year tail) when recruiters are introduced to new VC/PE/company opportunities.

“Beacon just automated an entire channel of BD our team manually tackled once a quarter.”

Another told us:

“We just hired another Operations person—but if you build BeaconAI, we won’t need to hire the next one. Every team at our company would want access.”

Wave,2021,"Wave transforms underused EAPs and fragmented mental health benefits into scalable, cost-effective coaching and behavioral care. We deliver high-impact, evidence-based support across the full spectrum of mental well-being—from stress and burnout to menopause and chronic illness—driving outcomes, engagement, and value for employers and their families.",https://wavelife.io,https://www.beautiful.ai/player/-ORSEt8AlH5lCE6IwpNI,https://www.beautiful.ai/player/-ORJ14p1Lts9TE_32QmP,"Millions face barriers to mental health care—cost, access, stigma, or poor fit. Traditional EAPs and therapy networks are falling short. Untreated mental health issues drive absenteeism, attrition, and healthcare costs. Wave bridges this gap with tech-enabled, coaching-first care that delivers measurable outcomes, improved access, and reduced cost of care at scale.",Sarah Adler https://www.linkedin.com/in/drsarahadler/,"We have an internal team, led by our Chief Technology Officer, Ryan Weald. All of our technology is built by Wave employees.","We currently have fifteen full-time Wave staff - seven engineering & product, four clinical staff, four G&A",N/A,"Yes - we brought our product to market in 2023. We spent the first two years in research & development, making sure the product (self-guided app + regular coaching sessions) worked, before we brought it to market.","Our target customers include payors and enterprise employers, though we do also work with SMBs. The biggest pain point across employers is attracting & retaining top talent, while also increasing productivity in their employee population.","Our ideal customer profile is an enterprise employer. There are over 20,000 enterprise employers in the US.","Headspace, Talkspace, and Better Help are examples of competitors. Wave improves the model by: not leveraging a “one-size fits all” care model, avoiding a short term treatment focus, and leveraging certified coaches as front-line providers of care, truly opening access.
One-size-fits-all care: Many competitors rely on standardized therapy models with little personalization. Wave meets members where they are—within hours. Whether someone is stressed, struggling, or in crisis, we deliver same-day support through app-based tools, certified coaching, or a licensed provider when needed.
Short Term Focus: Many solutions prioritize symptom checklists and brief interventions over sustainable, preventative mental health support. Wave supports individuals with low, moderate and high-acuity needs. Our coaches deliver evidence-based care across acuity levels. 
Lack of improvement to access: Many competitors leverage the same pool of licensed mental health providers and continue to weigh down the system. Wave is a coaching-first model, leveraging certified coaches to deliver outcomes immediately to employees in need of support, truly opening access.","We have several different verticals within our business model: B2B/Direct Employer, Health Plans Partnerships, and Distribution Channel & Referral Partnerships. We generate revenue through a mix of B2B monthly paid plans, distribution partnerships who pay for 1:1 provider sessions and health plan partnerships with varying financial arrangements.","We have seen significant growth in both B2B sales as well as our distribution channel & referral partnerships. We have added five new B2B clients in 2025, as well as twelve new partnership deals this year. We are also currently in final discussions with two large health plans, which would add 44M+ covered lives and includes strategic partnerships.","Our current sales pipeline spans three key verticals:B2B/Direct Employer Sales, Health Plans Partnerships, and Distribution Channel & Referral Partnerships. We have nearly thirty active clients including six B2B customers, nineteen distribution channel & referral partnerships & four health plans.","We currently have five paying B2B clients - who are all paying Per Employee, Per Month (PEPM) model. In addition, all of our partnership end-users pay out of pocket or through insurance for 1:1 provider sessions. Provider sessions are billed between $95 - $133/session, depending on the partnership agreement.","The typical sales cycle includes 2-3 meetings for smaller SMB clients & 4-6 meetings for enterprise clients. One observation is that typically purchasing timing coincides with a companies’ open enrollment. This can be attributed to additional budget for new initiatives in the employee benefit space. We typically see an HR director, or VP of People Operations make the final decision, though there is also influence from the CFO/budget decision maker to approve the cost of a program.","Our go-to-market strategy is shaped by strong market signals and direct customer feedback across all three of our core verticals.
Employer Demand (B2B):
We’ve seen a growing appetite from employers seeking to offer mental health and well-being support that is both cost-effective and scalable. HR leaders consistently cite provider access, employee utilization, and measurable outcomes as top priorities. 
Distribution & Referral Partnerships:
We've observed a strong pull from channel partners - ranging from healthcare providers to digital health platforms - looking for trusted referral options for their users. Many of these partners lack in-house mental health capabilities and are seeking high-quality, fast-access solutions to round out their offerings. With twenty active partnerships and continued inbound interest, this channel has proven to be both high-volume and low-cost in terms of acquisition.
Health Plans:
The increasing focus on behavioral health parity and the shift toward value-based care models have made mental health access a strategic priority for health plans. Our ongoing discussions with two large health plans (representing 44M+ covered lives) reflect a broader industry trend: payors are seeking differentiated partners that can offer both clinical quality and efficient delivery. Early feedback confirms alignment between our care model and their needs.
Across all verticals, customer interviews and sales conversations highlight the value of our hybrid payment model, ease of implementation, and clear ROI. These insights continue to shape our messaging, pricing, and product development efforts.","Wave is venture-backed, with funding led by Santé and supported by other notable health tech investors. Our latest round is currently in the closing phase to support B2B growth and payer expansion.","With current funding and deals in contract, we have runway for approximately 28 months. We expect to be cash flow positive in 2026.",TRUE,"We aim to form strategic partnerships with Fortune 100 employers, specifically focused on demonstrating Wave’s capacity to serve diverse populations at scale. We also look to refine our go-to-market and pricing  models through employer input.","In-network status across national insurance carriers is our largest barrier to success, although temporary. Employers + employees want to be able to use their current health plans to pay for care. We are currently in-network with 2 health plans and in contracting for multiple additional national plans.","As we scale, we're aware of a few key areas where additional knowledge, network access, or support would significantly accelerate our growth:
Health Plan Partnerships:
While we’re in late-stage conversations with two major payors, navigating the complexity of health plan partnerships, especially around deeper enterprise employer channel partnership guidance would be valuable.
B2B Development & Expansion:
Our early employer traction has been strong, but we’re still refining our go to market approach, pricing models, and demonstrating our capacity to serve diverse populations at scale.
Strategic Partnerships & Distribution Scaling:
We’ve had success building initial referral and channel partnerships, but we’re looking to scale this further.","One major learning came from observing the broader behavioral health landscape: despite widespread adoption, many solutions lacked meaningful outcomes data. Employers and payors were investing heavily in mental health benefits but couldn’t measure their impact - leading to questions around ROI and long-term value.
In response, we spent two years in research and development before launching Wave, ensuring our stepped-care model could deliver both fast access and measurable outcomes. From day one, we’ve tracked clinical and engagement metrics - like emotional resilience, symptom reduction, and utilization - because we knew outcomes would be essential for driving adoption and proving ROI. This commitment has become a key differentiator and foundation for our success with employers, health plan, and partnership channels.","Emily Wanderer, Director of Social Impact & Wellbeing at Sequoia, recommended us for the program.

Critical information—like financial accounts, insurance policies, and digital assets—is often scattered or hidden, leaving survivors overwhelmed and unprepared. 

This leads to lost assets, missed benefits, and emotional strain during an already difficult time. SmartHeritance helps individuals organize and securely share key information, so their families aren’t left in the dark when it matters most.

A common pitfall in legacy planning is the lack of ongoing discipline—people may start organizing their affairs but rarely keep things updated. Survivors often don’t know what exists, or who to contact when someone passes away. As a result, assets go unclaimed and critical benefits are missed. SmartHeritance addresses this with automated asset discovery and periodic wellness checks, ensuring that vital information stays current and reaches the right people automatically when it matters most.","Pravat Lall, Founder (https://www.linkedin.com/in/pravat/)",Hired an agency for engineering for now.,"Engineering - 6 (Agency)

•	73% of adults in the U.S. die without a will (source: Caring.com), yet most people have significant digital and financial footprints.
•	There is growing awareness of “digital legacy planning”, but very few solutions go beyond legal documents.
Insight: There’s demand for more practical, tech-enabled tools to organize and share critical life information, not just draft legal documents.
2. Pain Point Validated in Post-Death Scenarios
•	User interviews and anecdotal stories consistently highlight confusion and frustration among surviving family members:
“We didn’t even know where to start—bank accounts, insurance, passwords… everything was a mess.”
Insight: Focus messaging on the survivor’s experience and the emotional/financial cost of disorganized information.

•	Many people start estate or legacy planning but don’t keep it up-to-date.
•	Interviews show that even those with wills/trusts rarely update them, and very few securely share information with loved ones in a structured way.

The barrier wasn’t about importance; it was about discipline, emotional resistance, and the sheer effort involved.

People weren’t just avoiding legal documents—they were overwhelmed by the time it takes to track expenses, organize assets, and keep everything current. Many also pointed out that day-to-day financial details and expenses are a vital part of a family legacy, yet they’re often ignored.

That feedback changed everything. I saw clearly that automation wasn’t a nice-to-have—it was the only way to overcome apathy and make this stick.

This unlocks entirely new distribution channels for companies: alumni, freelancers, industry experts, and niche communities become your extended recruiting force.

This gives us the best of both worlds: the speed and quality of an experienced product team, with aligned incentives and no outsourcing risk. Importantly, it allows us to stay lean, we avoid fixed personnel costs when not actively building, so we can focus capital on growth and distribution. This setup is intentional and efficient for our current stage. As we scale, we plan to gradually build out key product and engineering roles within chainstaff to bring those capabilities fully in-house.","We’re an early-stage startup with a total team size of 4. The functional split is as follows:

- Engineering: 1 (via our strategic tech partner and investor, Saynode Operations AG)
- Product & Operations: 1
- Strategy & G&A: 1
- Marketing & Growth: 1","It started with a big vision: I (Alessandro) imagined a data monetization layer for recruitment - CVs verified on the blockchain, auto-issued credentials, a skill ontology, and candidates earning money whenever their data was used. Ambitious? Definitely. Probably too ambitious for a v1.

Curious about feasibility, I reached out to saynode operations - a Swiss leader in mobile-first blockchain applications - to explore a potential collaboration. While they agreed the idea was a bit ahead of its time, something clicked immediately.

They shared their own pain: while hiring, they were frustrated by the high costs of job ads and recruiting fees. Why does posting a job or making a hire cost thousands? There had to be a better way. And that’s where chainstaff was born. Merging our shared frustration into a simpler, more urgent opportunity: a monetized, community-powered referral system that flips recruiting economics on its head.","Yes. We launched an early prototype in August 2024 to test core mechanics and validate market interest. After closing that phase in November, we began building the full MVP based on feedback.

Although we are also in contact with large corporations since our solutions fits in their need too.

Their biggest pain points vary, but they share a common theme: hiring is inefficient, costly, and hard to scale. Specifically:

Cost predictability: Traditional recruiting channels are expensive and unpredictable. With chainstaff, companies set the bounty upfront and only pay on successful hires, giving full control over hiring spend.

Scaling referrals: Many companies already use internal referral programs but want to expand reach beyond employees. We enable them to tap into external networks without additional complexity.

Manual processes: Some companies still manage referrals in Excel, with manual tracking and payments. chainstaff fully automates the process making it seamless, transparent, and scalable.

We help these companies reduce costs, accelerate time-to-hire, and unlock the full potential of network-based recruiting - all without upfront risk.","We’re initially targeting medium-sized companies (50–250 employees) in the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland). This segment includes approximately 10,000 companies employing around 6 million people. With a typical net job fluctuation of ~10%, this results in 600,000 job changes annually within this segment alone.","Our competitors include:

Traditional recruiting agencies (e.g. Hays, Adecco): These are expensive (15–30% of first-year salary), slow, and not performance-aligned. They also offer limited transparency and scalability.

Job platforms (e.g. LinkedIn, Indeed): While they offer reach, they don’t activate networks or offer incentives for successful referrals. It’s pay-to-post, not pay-for-performance.

Internal referral tools (e.g. Firstbird, Radancy): These focus only on employees, closed systems that don’t scale beyond the company. They often require upfront SaaS fees and don’t solve the real distribution challenge.

What they get wrong:
They treat referrals as an add-on - we treat them as the core channel. Most fail to unlock the full power of external networks or to build fair, automated reward mechanisms. chainstaff is designed to be radically simple, risk-free (pay only on success), and infinitely scalable, turning every person into a recruiter without friction.","chainstaff currently operates on a performance-based, success-fee model. Companies post jobs with a self-defined bounty (e.g. 1,000–5,000). When a candidate is hired through a referral, chainstaff charges a 30% platform fee on the total bounty - paid only upon a successful hire. There are no upfront costs, no subscriptions, and zero risk for employers.

This model aligns incentives perfectly: companies only pay when they see value, and referrers are rewarded for results. It’s simple, transparent, and scales naturally with hiring volume.

In parallel, we are actively exploring a licensing model for larger organizations that already have established referral programs but lack automation and external reach. This model would offer companies their own branded version of chainstaff, complete with internal controls, analytics, and full automation. We're conducting market validation and prototyping through Q3 2025, with the goal of launching enterprise pilots by October.

This dual approach allows us to stay lean and scalable with SMEs while unlocking long-term ARR potential with enterprise clients.","Over the last 6 months, we’ve built early traction while testing and refining the model:

- 5 successful hires through the platform

- 550+ users engaged as referrers

- 90 job listings published by early partner companies

- Hire success rate currently matches traditional job ads (~5–6%)

These results validate both demand and usability. We're now focused on improving conversion through targeted onboarding, better job-referrer matching, and performance analytics - with the goal of reaching a 10% success rate by end of 2025, and 15%+ by 2026.

We’ve proven the concept works, now we’re scaling it.","We’ve onboarded around 40 companies to date, primarily small and mid-sized businesses across Switzerland. We're now focused on converting these early users into recurring customers and brand ambassadors, leveraging their networks to drive awareness and referrals.

Our sales pipeline includes:

- 3 larger Swiss corporations currently in active discussions, and several medium sized.
- A growing outreach to German mid-sized firms, supported by our advisory team
- Ongoing efforts to expand into sectors with high talent needs (e.g. healthcare, logistics, IT)

At this stage, we rely heavily on personal introductions and relationship-based selling. While not yet fully scalable, this approach has proven to be the most effective for gaining trust and access to decision-makers in the early phase. As we grow, we plan to formalize our sales funnel and layer in outbound automation and partnerships to scale acquisition.","So far, 5 companies have paid referral fees. At this stage, there is no additional pricing model, allowing us to focus on traction and product-market fit. However, we plan to introduce a licensing and subscription-based model for larger organizations starting in Q3 2025, offering advanced features such as branded portals, analytics, and internal program automation.","Our sales cycle is typically very fast, especially for initial activation. Since chainstaff has no upfront costs, we convert around 80% of companies after the first intro call, often within just a few days. For companies that use us as a standalone solution, onboarding is immediate.

For those integrating chainstaff into their existing Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), the full onboarding process can take 2 to 6 weeks, depending on technical complexity and stakeholder alignment. In those cases, the decision-making usually involves HR leadership, sometimes IT, and occasionally procurement or legal for approval of automated payouts.

The process is currently led by Alessandro (CEO) and supported by our advisory board to reach decision-makers directly.","Referrals are already the #1 source of quality hires: According to LinkedIn’s Global Recruiting Trends, consistently outperform other channels in speed, cost, and retention.

Yet most referral programs are underutilized: Companies often lack the tools to scale referrals beyond their employees, and many still run programs manually via email or spreadsheets. This is especially true for mid-sized companies.

Our early pilots confirm the gap: In our first phase, 40+ companies joined without upfront costs, and 5 paid out successful referral bounties. Many of them expressed the same pain: high recruiting costs, low reach, and no structured referral tools beyond internal programs.

We’ve seen a fast activation rate: ~80% of companies we speak to convert after an intro call. HR teams appreciate the performance-based pricing and the simplicity of setup.","We are currently self-funded and have received two substantial non-dilutive grants to support the development of our prototype and MVP. These grants allowed us to validate the concept, build the core technology, and onboard early customers without taking on outside capital.

We are now in active discussions to finalize our seed round, which we expect to close soon. This funding will be used to accelerate product development, scale our go-to-market efforts, and support the rollout of our enterprise offering.",18 months,TRUE,"We see the SemperVirens Accelerator as the perfect strategic match for chainstaff, and our main goal during the program is to accelerate distribution into the exact customer segment you specialize in.

Specifically, we aim to:
- Refine our enterprise sales motion, especially for mid-sized and larger organizations in the HR tech ecosystem.

- Access key decision-makers through the program’s curated introductions, which would help us land our first enterprise pilot partnerships and scale beyond our current SMB base.

- Validate and launch our enterprise licensing model with guidance of strategic experts.

Beyond tactical growth, we’re looking to position chainstaff as a breakthrough platform in network-based recruiting, and we believe SemperVirens could be a strong partner to help us get there.","Achieving network effect at scale: Our model becomes more powerful as more companies and referrers join. So reaching critical mass fast is essential. Early traction has been good, but scaling sustainably while maintaining quality is a key challenge.

Shifting buyer mindsets: Many companies are used to traditional recruiting channels and may hesitate to adopt performance-based referral systems.

Balancing two-sided onboarding: As a platform, we need to onboard both companies and referrers. While we’ve streamlined the experience, ensuring steady growth and engagement on both sides remains a delicate balance.

That’s exactly why we’re excited about the SemperVirens Accelerator: your team and network are uniquely positioned to help us break through these barriers, especially distribution and enterprise adoption.","While we’re strong in product, strategy, and early-stage sales, our biggest gap is in marketing and scalable customer acquisition. We’ve relied heavily on founder-led outreach and our advisory network, which has worked well for early traction, but we now need to build a repeatable, data-driven growth engine.","One of the most important pieces of feedback we received early on was that our original vision - building a blockchain-based CV verification and skill-matching infrastructure - was too ambitious and too abstract for immediate market adoption. While technically exciting, it lacked a clear entry point and monetization path.

We listened. Instead of forcing a big, complex idea, we zoomed in on a very real and painful problem every company faces.

That learning led us to pivot - from a future-facing tech stack to a practical, ROI-driven platform. We kept the spirit of our original vision (empowering individuals to own and monetize their data), but grounded it in a tangible, urgent solution companies could adopt today. That shift gave us traction, revenue, and momentum.",Linkedin Post,No,TRUE,alessandro@chainstaff.info,6/3/2025 8:44:10,x58x4esx7mujkhajko2x58x4en0mp3hz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
