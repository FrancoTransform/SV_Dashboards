A few product features include   Care Circle  My CareLinq’s service revolves around the concept of a Care Circle. There is at least one family caregiver in a Care Circle. At the nucleus of a Care Circle is the identity and profile of the person receiving care (the care recipient or person-in-care). All activities and communications orbit around the Care Circle and are documented within various sections of the care plan associated with a person receiving care.   There is a Care Plan associated with a Care Circle. The Care Plan is a record of care planning activities, decisions, suggestions, communications, wishes and instructions made for the person-in-care.  When an end-user creates an account, the Care Plan begins to document and track all participant activities. This Care Plan is associated with the Care Circle. A Care Plan can be shared among caregivers in the Care Circle as well as the designated Care Concierge for the Care Circle.    We believe a family caregiving service and solution must account for multiple participants that are involved in some capacity in providing care.  To empower family caregivers they need the communication and collaboration tools that enables transparency, support, and faster decision making.  Even Care Concierges must be invited into the Care Circle to be a participant and assist, although not necessary to get services.   ",2,"No  minimum headcount.

These materials undergo a comprehensive legal review before being disseminated externally. This array of resources includes brochures, one-page overviews, wallet cards, and product demo videos. To maintain accuracy and accessibility, we diligently update these materials on a quarterly basis, ensuring they are readily accessible to your Product, Marketing, and Account teams via our communications portal.  For pre-enrollment educational materials, meticulous attention is given to their creation and peer review by Talkspace's Clinical Content Team. This team comprises experienced and licensed therapists with diverse expertise in various behavioral health fields. They generate content for groups, producers, and members, and also contribute to Talkspace's consumer blog. Their insights have been featured in renowned media outlets, including The New York Times and Cosmopolitan Magazine. Common content formats include articles and videos, with new content becoming available every quarter. Just like enrollment materials, these resources can be accessed by your teams through our communications portal.  Post-enrollment, members receive account-related and marketing communications through our app, email, and push notifications, which accompany them throughout their care journey. Each member receives Talkspace's welcome series via email, providing them with valuable information about our services and setting them up for success. Account-related messages, appointment reminders, message notifications, and assessment result notifications are delivered securely through the app, email, and push notifications, while respecting HIPAA guidelines. We take extra care to ensure that sensitive treatment details, such as clinical survey results and messaging transcripts, are not shared via email or push notifications.

Our marketing messages primarily focus on experience surveys, benefit availability reminders, and new service features. These messages are thoughtfully developed by our Marketing team, ensuring compliance with regulations and undergoing review by multiple teams, including Product, Legal, and Clinical Network, based on the subject matter.  Our automation platforms operate on a de-identified data basis, delivering personalized communications to members to assist them in navigating their care experience. These communications are tailored based on registration date, benefit plan (such as payer), chosen care (therapy vs. psychiatry), and care plan, including live session bookings.",F_YYv07lG8TntrsWJ,TS_B2B_0854_Comms_Brochure.pdf,5591034,application/pdf,"At Talkspace, we believe in the immense value of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB).

Additionally, Talkspace employs a robust access control system, which is pivotal in the process of granting or revoking access to any functionality within our platform. This system is fortified with Segregation of Duties (SOD) principles and is subjected to biannual access audits. The roles managed by this system are endowed with varying security levels to ensure the highest standards of data protection and system integrity.","For our core therapy/psychiatry app, these are the primary elements included in quarterly reporting:    Registration - Defined as the number of members who are aware of the Talkspace benefit and decide to sign up. The number of registrations is often closely tied to how an institution communicates the benefit to their members, and reflects the demand/need for therapy.   Engagement - Defined as the average length of time users stay active with Talkspace and what modalities they are using. Many members sign up for therapy just to try it out, while there are also those who find it very helpful, so they commit to the completion of the program. Engaged users over time shows the proportion of users active over time (per week since conversion), scaled by the initial number of users active in the first week of the timeframe.   Clinical Effectiveness - The measurement of if and how much users are seeing improvement in their mental health over time, taking into consideration if they are simply feeling better coupled with true symptom reduction. Effectiveness is measured through clinical assessments (i.e. depression, anxiety, etc.) that users are prompted to complete in order to assess improvement. We administer clinical surveys at 21-day increments and track the progress of users by comparing baseline scores to follow-up survey scores. If a user scores lower on a follow-up survey than on their baseline, this user is deemed to show improvement.  Users Improvement by Gender: We track and analyze the progress made by users based on gender, providing valuable data on gender-specific improvements and trends within your member population.  Users Improvement by Age: By examining user improvement across different age groups, we offer insights into how various age demographics benefit from Talkspace, allowing you to understand the effectiveness of our platform across different life stages.  Users Improvement by Presenting Problem: We monitor and assess the progress of users based on their presenting problems or mental health concerns, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of Talkspace in addressing specific issues.  Effectiveness on Depression: We measure the effectiveness of Talkspace in alleviating symptoms of depression, providing data on the positive impact our platform has on individuals struggling with depressive symptoms.  Effectiveness on Anxiety: We evaluate the effectiveness of Talkspace in reducing symptoms of anxiety, offering insights into how our platform supports individuals in managing and overcoming anxiety-related challenges.  Effectiveness at work: We assess the impact of Talkspace on member related issues, such as stress management, work-life balance, and overall mental well-being, demonstrating the positive influence our platform can have on employees' professional lives.  User Profile - User profile data includes demographics and data collected at registration for each user. It is manually inputted by the user when prompted. Understanding which members are more likely to utilize the service is helpful. You can view data on how many users are trying therapy for the first time, in addition to a breakdown of age, gender, location, and the most common presenting issues.   Provider Satisfaction - When users reach certain life cycle thresholds, they will be prompted to complete a therapist check-in survey. They will provide a rating from 1 to 5 for their therapist, as well as satisfaction reasons. Satisfaction is measured on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being very satisfied with the therapist.    With the Talkspace Self-Guided program, via the admin user Talkspace Engage portal, the dashboard is provided in real-time and shows:  Utilization - Users can see how many people have registered and how many are actively using the app and utilization percentages.  Self-Guided Sessions Taken - Users may view at any time the number of sessions their members are completing as well as the top five topics.  Classes Booked - Users can view the number of people attending live classes and the top five class subjects.  Assessments - Users can also view the types of assessments members are taking and then view the ranking by topic, e.g. relationship issues, anxiety, & burnout.

Our three core services; Therapy, Psychiatry, and Self-Guided, are accessed through our secure, proprietary apps and/or website.   Therapy, is conducted via both unlimited asynchronous communication, and scheduled live virtual sessions. Individuals aged 13 and above  can message their 1:1,dedicated therapist via text, audio or video, as often as they wish, anytime of the day or night, 7 days a week; their therapist engages via the same types of messaging, daily, 5 days per week (5 days based on therapist’s chosen schedule, not only Monday through Friday). Asynchronous messaging eliminates the significant barrier that prevents people from accessing strictly appointment-based behavioral care; scheduling and commuting to a recurring therapy appointment. If they choose, users can also engage in virtual sessions with their dedicated therapist, conducted live, via video, phone or chat, and can conveniently schedule just 2 - 4 days in advance, often sooner.   Psychiatry is conducted 1:1 with a dedicated state Board Certified Psychiatrist or state Licensed Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner through live video appointments. Individuals aged 18 and above can access initial consultations, assessments, evaluations, diagnoses, and ongoing medication management. The seamless communication between Talkspace therapists with Talkspace licensed prescribers on the platform simplifies the sharing of treatment plans. Upon registration, individuals can typically schedule their first session within 4-7 days, all from the comfort and privacy of their home, or private location of their choice.  Talkspace Self-Guided is dedicated to expanding wellness/wellbeing and behavioral health services through evidence-based solutions. Self-Guided empowers individuals 13 and older to take control of their progress, offering clinically supported programs that address various aspects of their lives, in core areas, including personal well-being, work-life issues, couples & relationships, teen & young adult concerns, and parenting. These programs cover a wide array of both common and unique topics such as anxiety, depression, burnout, alcohol and substance use, diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as healthy relationships, work/life effectiveness and so many others. Individuals take part in each program they choose at their own pace and convenience, through a series of brief 3 - 7 minute exercises (called “sessions”) designed to be stimulating and engaging, such as self-assessments, journaling, meditations, videos, gamification, and more. When they complete one program’s exercises, individuals are encouraged to begin another program that fits their needs. Additionally, Talkspace Self-Guided includes Live Interactive, Group Classes led by licensed therapists, addressing essential aspects of the human experience, including topical, current, popular issues and situations realted the core Self-Guided areas of personal well-being, work-life issues, couples & relationships, teen & young adult concerns, and parenting. Each week there are 4 - 6 new and unique live classes held; some examples are Managing Work Stress, Tracking Anxiety triggers, Aligning Parenting Styles, Healing broken Trust, Sleep Management & Exam Fatique, Dealing with Difficult Classmates. Upon completion, all classes have been recorded and become a part of our on-demand class library, of 400+ classes and growing, accessible to users 24/7/365.  Self-Guided also has daily reflections to keep individuals engaged, supplementary resources, and an ever-growing content library.",17,,"The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is by its title, an Employer’s issue, not directly a Talkspace issue. Talkspace does not take a role in the reporting required of the Employer. ERISA generally applies when an employer establishes and maintains, through the purchase of insurance or otherwise, an “employee welfare benefit plan” for the benefit of its employees and their beneficiaries. An “employee welfare benefit plan” includes any plan, fund or program providing medical, surgical, or hospital care or benefits, or benefits in the event of sickness, accident, or disability or unemployment.  Because the potential benefits available through Talkspace include mental health counseling, the Talkspace Benefits (including EAP) do fall within the Employer’s ERISA reporting requirements.   ERISA requires that an employee welfare benefit plan be set forth in writing and that each participant be provided with a summary plan description (“SPD”), which includes certain required information to inform participants of their rights and sets forth the plan’s claims procedures. Talkspace can provide the Employer assistance in creating the report by offering the Talkspace Description of Standard Services.  If the Employer’s plan covers 100 or more participants, the employer will be required to file annual reports (using Form 5500) with the Department of Labor. If an annual report Form 5500 is required, ERISA requires that covered participants and certain beneficiaries must receive an annual statement summarizing the latest annual report for the plan. Again, Talkspace role is only in offering the required description of the Talkspace benefit.  Employers typically consider EAP benefits as a sub-plan or component of their overall group health benefit program and part of their Form 5500.   Another common approach is for employers to maintain a welfare “WRAP” plan whereby all of the employer’s welfare benefit programs are wrapped together under a single umbrella plan for purposes of ERISA. Adopting a WRAP plan document enables the plan sponsor to collapse Form 5500 filings (life, disability, medical, mental health, dental, vision, etc.) into a single filing. Thus, the Talkspace Program would simply be an additional benefit program offered under the WRAP plan reporting.  Even if an employer chooses to treat the Talkspace Program as a separate stand-alone plan, the employer should again be able to attach the required SPD disclosures and claims procedures using the “Talkspace Standard Description of Services” to create an ERISA compliant document.",1,"The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives employees who lose their health benefits the right to choose to continue group health benefits provided by their group health plan for limited periods of time under certain circumstances, usually for 18 months following the end of employment. Both Talkspace Direct to Employer offerings and EAP offerings are likely to be considered part of a “Group Health Plan” for purposes of determining COBRA eligibility. Talkspace can, at the Employers' guidance, continue to charge the PEPM charge for the eighteen months (or as long as the employee wants COBRA up to 18 months) and the employer will decide to pay the minor cost or pass along only the monthly PEPM to the ex-employee to pay as part of their now privately paid health care cost. The same applies to an EAP cost transferred to the employee.",,2,,1,See the document attached.,F_XvK6Y05tvbsUU7f,2022_talkspace_legal_issues_summary_.docx.pdf,170344,application/pdf,2,,"It's a covered insurance benefit.

New clients implementing Lifestyle Spending Accounts can have anywhere between a 4 week and 8 week implementation depending on the complexity of the program. (Current clients adding new accounts can have those added as quickly as 5 business days).   Internally the Account Executive schedules a transition call with the assigned Onboarding Manager to discuss what sold, the customers timeline, any customization requests and completes a transfer document that confirms systems, program details and other notes taken during the sales process.    The Onboarding Manager then sends a welcome email to the new customer. This email requests availability for a kick off call and includes a link to the electronic onboarding tool that collects client information. Forma uses an electronic onboarding site to collect program decisions and parameters about the plan being implemented.The email suggests the client begins to complete key details about the company under the general information section ahead of the scheduled kick off call and will review the other sections during the call.   The agenda of the kick off call includes: introductions, an executive summary to confirm key information, an implementation timeline with key milestone dates and deliverables discussed, an overview of the different workstreams throughout onboarding including system integrations / SSO, Accounting, Communications culture / launch, post launch and more.   A section regarding “working together” is also covered which set expectations of who may need to join certain calls, how they prefer to be communicated with and discusses any potential holidays / time off that could impact implementation calls.   The onboarding manager is responsible for sending a weekly agenda to set expectations and post call notes to confirm key deliverables are moving forward week over week. If at any point the launch is at risk because of missed deadlines the onboarding manager loops back in the Account Executive to help escalate with their key contacts.   During onboarding the onboarding manager also shares a customer specific notion page that includes all details related to the implementation a customer may need. Sections include: links to onboarding confirmations, meeting notes, program policy, a resource center which contains help articles on SSO, SCIM, file testing, etc, communication / launch toolkit, employee support reminders.   Additional video tutorial regarding the electronic onboarding site can be found here, under “Forma Basics”. The videos includes overviews on: creating the program parameters, reviewing and signing off on the program policy, file testing (if managing in house and not with a Third party vendor), and more!  https://customer-hub.joinforma.com/ Password: Benefit$Hero  Close to the launch date once the demographic file is in place, the onboarding manager does internal testing with operations and Q/As the customers site.

With every customer, we take their unique goals of the program into consideration and that can impact what types of communications are turned on.    Options for employee engagement include: 1.) system generated emails include: activation emails, emails communicating when funds are loaded and available, emails communicating when funds are close to expiration, approved, pending, denied claims.

With regard to our competitors, we are the most cost effective solution, have the shortest implementation period, and are the most customizable. We recognize that offering student loan repayment as a benefit is not a one-size fits all solution and give the employers the ability to set specific rules that help their attraction and retention goals.

We can move as fast as the client would like with very minimal work needed from the customer.   First, on an initial call our team will work with the client to develop custom desired rules for their tax-free educational plan such as tenure rules, maximum lifetime contributions etc. Our team will then create a custom educational assistance plan to comply with the IRS tax code 127. Additionally on this call our team will help clients connect their HRIS system to our platform. With this connection, employers don't have to worry about managing onboarding or off-boarding of employees or monthly file feeds. If preferred we can always collect monthly census files instead.   Once the plan has been finalized we provide the client with custom launch collateral to announce their benefit to the team. We are always willing to manage the announcement on our end, however, typically we like our clients to make the first announcement to maximize adoption but more importantly so the HR team gets the credit they deserve for launching such a forward looking impactful benefit.

One week after that announcement, we send a reminder to any employees who have not yet enrolled. If an employee has signed up but has not completed their enrollment, we send an enrollment reminder instead.   For any new employees, Highway sends a welcome email when the Employee officially joins the company and then follows the same reminder cadence. This will automatically be picked up by our rostering system and does not require notification from the employer about new employees.  In total, Highway sends 1-3 emails to each employee during their onboarding period to notify and engage eligible employees without spamming their inbox.   After an employee has enrolled, Highway sends an email every month after the benefit has been processed and sends a celebratory email when a loan has been paid off.

First and foremost to be eligible an employer must have a written plan which Highway provides prior to launch. Some additional requirements include announcement of the benefit, that employers don't favor towards highly compensated individuals, and employees can't be offered the benefit in exchange for taxable benefits.   Finally and most importantly Highway verifies that an employee has a qualified educational loan that is in their name and sends contributions directly into those loans.

The grand majority of ""member inquiries"" come through our web platform. Our live chat tool has an average response time under 2 minutes. We employ a fully remote workforce of agile, flexible, committed team members and as such, we don’t operate or outsource to a call center. Instead, our Care Coordinators work closely with each family to create the right communication rhythm. Care Coordinators will regularly schedule calls with families before or after working hours and will respond to messages nearly around the clock. We also operate an 877 number staffed from Monday - Friday from 8am - 10pm ET.  This line assists with any general questions or concerns member might have. Please note that if a family is experiencing a medical emergency, we recommend they dial 911.","At Wellthy, exceptional service is embedded in our culture. We pride ourselves in delivering not only excellent service but also a profound impact to both our clients and members. Each client gets a dedicated Client Success team, as we believe in proactive engagement, anticipating client needs, and acting with urgency.

Our commitment to strong partnerships is reflected in our 90+ Client NPS score and long-lasting relationships with clients. Like Sequoia, we go above and beyond, ensuring our clients always feel valued, understood, and prioritized.","The Wellthy Care Team is made up of Care Coordinators, Care Advisers, Care Managers, and Member Support. The majority of Wellthy’s Care Coordinators are social workers by training and can personally relate to the families they work with. Many have previously worked in hospital, insurance, and other healthcare and clinical settings. We carefully screen all candidates before certifying someone as a Wellthy Care Coordinator. We provide Care Coordinators with specific guidelines on the “Wellthy Way,” as well as processes, protocols, and a central knowledge-base.   We are the largest administrator of social workers in the caregiving industry. Nearly 70% of Wellthy Coordination team members have experience in clinical and/or medical social work. About 20% hold a Master’s degree in social work, and 50% have a Master’s degree or higher in a social work-related specialty (such as counseling, nursing, patient advocacy, health administration, gerontology, or human services). Care Coordinators have an average of 6+ years of work experience in relevant clinical or non-clinical healthcare settings. They must also have a college degree, and most have an advanced degree relevant to the role, i.e., Master’s or Ph.D. in social work, certification in patient advocacy, etc. Wellthy requires a minimum of 5 years of work experience, while our Sr. Care Coordinators and Managers have upwards of 10+ years of experience.   Our Client Success team works directly with employer clients. Client Success Managers have an average of 7 years of client service and account management experience. Implementation Specialists, who temporarily work with clients during implementation, have an average of 5 years of implementation related experience.",,1,1,,,1,1,1,Our recent Client NPS is 91 and Member NPS is 80.,,"Implementation is turnkey and is managed by a dedicated Implementation Specialist who is responsible for establishing a project plan that outlines key implementation milestones. We also assign a dedicated Wellthy Client Success Manager who provides ongoing, proactive support during and post-implementation. We partner closely with our clients during implementation to ensure our service and technology will meet the needs of their specific employee population. The process includes an implementation form that helps Wellthy gather important information, including the following:  List of office locations and employee headcounts Many of the employers we work with have multiple offices. We love to plan events like lunch and learns, office hours, and pop-ups to raise awareness of Wellthy. We also host virtual events so remote employees can tune in!  Company communications and events calendar We create custom content that highlights a hot topic in healthcare or trend we’re seeing in the caregiving space. Each month, we will send your team a specific deliverable along with a forwardable note related to that topic. We hope that our message templates make it easy to distribute to all employees or integrate into any form of internal communication or onsite events.  Up-to-date benefits guide We like to arm our Care Coordinators with information on your insurance plans, other benefit offerings, and perks so they understand what resources employees have available to them, and so we can cross-refer when appropriate.  Eligibility verification Employees must confirm their eligibility to set up a Wellthy account. We offer the following eligibility verification options: SFTP eligibility file, email domain, and unique code.     We'll host a kickoff call prior to launch to discuss tactics to build awareness of Wellthy, learn more about your other benefit offerings, and develop a marketing plan for your entire team. Our standard implementation timeframe is 45 days. The entire implementation process can take 4-6 weeks, sometimes even less, once the contract is finalized and countersigned. The implementation fee is a one-time fee incurred when the project kicks off.  We partner with our clients to execute marketing campaigns, webinars, and other bespoke initiatives like direct-to-employee email campaigns, direct-mail postcards, translated materials, ERG workshops, and management training resources as part of our engagement strategy. Additionally, we provide content around specific client business objectives and initiatives, for example, developing webinars and resources for veteran support where a client is specifically aiming to engage that segment of their population.",F_1GVKlwmMan4hvGe,2023_What to Expect During Your Wellthy Implementation .pdf,70469,application/pdf,1,"We typically do not offer termination for convenience as our pricing is dependent on contract length. In rare instances where we do agree to it, we don't allow termination in the first year, require 90 days notice to ensure that families are not adversely affected, and seek to recoup any discounts or free services given as part of a longer-term agreement.","Caregiving can be a silent and hidden burden. It won't come up in claims data, and almost anyone, at any time, could be shouldering this extra responsibility. On top of that, there’s a stigma in our society, and people often don't share the tough family care issues they're grappling with at home.   At Wellthy, we feel strongly that part of our job is to raise awareness of the very-real challenges of caregiving and to bring down the barriers that are preventing help for those who need it.  In collaboration with our clients, we work hard to craft a marketing and awareness-building program for caregivers. We build messaging and materials and strive to keep a steady drumbeat of communication around awareness and to drive engagement. Additionally, we find manager support and word of mouth are critical drivers of utilization. Often, managers can help identify team members who are distracted, stressed, and struggling with mental health issues, all of which are common warning signals of caregiving stress.  Here's a quick overview of how Wellthy plans and executes an engagement strategy to drive ongoing utilization:  At launch:  -Create a custom marketing toolkit for your company with messaging templates, talking points, and digital collateral to help get the word out. -Host a live ""Meet Wellthy"" workshop with Q&A to promote awareness among employees and to introduce our services.  Post launch:  -Execute an engagement strategy to drive ongoing utilization including: -Monthly newsletters to our clients contain forwardable blurbs, downloadable content, and links to upcoming Wellthy webinars. -Direct-to-employee communications to share gated content and receive other opt-in marketing communications messaging. -Build relationships with employee resource groups (ERGs) and other employee-led groups to support their populations through training materials, messaging templates, webinars, and events. -Our ever-expanding content infrastructure and integrated resources within our platform and apps foster an educational experience that facilitates the creation of an account by employees, before they may even need one — so getting started will be that much easier when they do.",,,,,"At Wellthy, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) are embedded into our organizational DNA. As a female-founded and led company, our current team is 83% female and 36% ethnically diverse. Wellthy has built robust measures and practices to ensure a diverse hiring pipeline. We use sourcing platforms tailored around diversity and inclusion, and our job postings include Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) statements and encourage candidates who need accommodations to contact us. In addition, Wellthy maintains an Ideal Candidate Profile Guide to focus on skill-based evaluations to minimize potential bias in candidate selection. Our Talent team also has set clear goals to ensure diversity across hiring: 60% of initial phone screens and 40-50% of candidates advancing through the interview process are targeted to be from diverse backgrounds. Furthermore, we partner with DE&I consultant groups who collaborate with our internal DE&I Council to provide training to our teams, and continually fine-tune our recruitment and retention strategies to align with our DE&I commitments.  At the product level, we are sensitive to the unique needs of each family and incorporate Social Determinants of Health. Our onboarding and communication processes are designed to help Care Coordinators understand each family's specific circumstances and preferences, ensuring our services are culturally and linguistically appropriate. We provide localized caregiving support in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Ireland, with Care Coordinators fluent in English, Spanish, and Canadian French. Wellthy provides a broad range of services that go beyond common complex care situations to support families with diverse needs. We provide support across the full spectrum of care and regularly support families with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Autism Spectrum, Dyspraxia, Dyslexia, Tourette Syndrome, and others. Many of our team members have personal experience with neurodiversity and disabilities, making our support services particularly meaningful. Our expertise covers areas such as behavioral health, women's health, childcare, HIV, chronic conditions, veteran support, and gerontology. We're also dedicated to LGBTQ+ advocacy and support, assisting with mental health support, gender-affirming care, and LGBTQ+ friendly provider identification, among other services.  When we help a family find outside support, we want to ensure that the family and care recipient are fully comfortable with the caregiver, living facility, or another provider. Families can request attributes like gender, religious background, and personality. These preferences can be collected as part of our onboarding process, on a call with a Care Coordinator, or within communications on the platform. Please note that Wellthy prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin in accordance with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.",2,"An eligibility file is our preferred method of verifying eligibility, but we have other options such as domain name and Single Sign-On (SSO).",,,,,,1,1,1,1,"Our platform has SSO capabilities and we use Auth0 to power this experience.

With an extensive team of care experts and a robust digital platform, Wellthy provides personalized and dedicated support for family caregivers. Unlike other care companies, we aren’t just resource providers or navigators — we are doers. By completing the logistical and administrative tasks of care, Wellthy helps improve retention, reduce time away, give time back, and increase productivity, all while giving people the support they desperately need to care for themselves and those they love. Wellthy's platform consists of the following key components: Care Concierge, Backup Care (coming in Q1 of 2024), Wellthy Community, and Care Planning, each integrating digital and human elements to offer comprehensive caregiving support.  Through Care Concierge, Wellthy helps families get things done. Families can create and manage Care Projects in the Care Dashboard, a centralized hub with tools, resources, tasks, and to-dos all in one place. After creating a Care Project, Wellthy matches families with a best-fit Care Coordinator who can support families across all phases of life, including aging, childcare, teen support, health conditions, disabilities, neurodiversity, mental and behavioral health, veterans support, financial support, end of life and loss, and LGBTQ+ gender affirmation and advocacy, and more. Care Coordinators help unburden and uplift family caregivers by accomplishing tasks on their behalf. The Care Coordinator will serve as the single point-of-contact for the family and create a custom plan based on the needs of the caregiver, the care recipient, their current situation, and the family's goals.   Wellthy's Backup Care offering will officially launch in Q1 of 2024. With this service, our experts will identify and vet local, flexible, and reliable backup care options, guide and educate families on the reimbursement process, and promote proactive planning through allowing employees to build a Care Circle, a personal backup care network that families can create in the Wellthy platform, for unanticipated circumstances and gaps in care. The Care Circle can include not only trusted providers but also friends, family members, and neighbors.  With Wellthy Community, we help families feel less alone. Wellthy Community is an expert-moderated peer-to-peer network where families can gain support and share knowledge with other caregivers. Wellthy Community offers a variety of caregiving forums for connection and more focused discussion on topics that are most relevant to members’ own care situations. Moderators regularly host discussions and post tips, questions, featured content, webinars and events for members to participate and engage with others. Families can feel less alone by exchanging caregiving advice and sharing their stories.  At Wellthy, we help families plan ahead and learn. Care Planning is a planning tool that empowers and guides families to prepare in advance for both expected and unexpected life events, offering support for logistical, administrative, emotional, legal, and financial planning needs. Families can create comprehensive, step-by-step Care Plans to stay organized, keep track of action items, and access digital resources that guide them through their future caregiving journeys.",17,,Wellthy's position is that it's not our decision to make whether we will be deemed ERISA or not.

For companies like Wellthy (and many others), tax law is not explicit and is quite vague on whether our service should be taxed or is exempt. Currently, 97% of our employer clients consider Wellthy an exempt benefit, including a large consulting company that has a tax practice. Our legal counsel’s view is that Wellthy’s services fit within the de minimis exclusion given that the annual PEPM spend is below $100, and given that the benefits of Wellthy are received by the employer (retention, reduced leaves, increased productivity) in addition to the value received by the employee. That said, we are happy to accommodate your preference. We do have four clients that consider Wellthy taxable. Of the four, two have selected to gross up the cost and cover it, and two have selected to impute income and have the employee pay the tax expense. In all four cases, the taxable period is during the months when an employee has an active care project within our Concierge, and we do not recommend taxing for employees who sign up, download the app, attend webinars or events, use Community, engage with content, or utilize any other non-Concierge experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He and a team of like-minded parents created Juno to help fill this financial protection ""gap"" for all parents that hadn't been addressed in the United States.  Background  While large employers protect families from the financial risk of premature death and disability, parents are universally exposed to potentially severe financial hardships if their child becomes severely disabled, ill, or injured. Forward-thinking employers now have an opportunity to fill a gap in core coverage, demonstrate leadership in family benefits and deliver a return on investment that wows employees.  The impact on parents and employers  2 million working families have a child with a severe disability 73% of these parents report cutting back working hours or leaving the workforce due to increased caregiving needs that can average 53 hours per week Businesses also pay the price in lost productivity and turnover disproportionately impacting women's careers as well as their mental and financial wellbeing   How Juno protects all working parents  Juno covers all children, including adopted, foster, and step children to age 26 Parents receive personal guidance plus tax-advantaged cash benefits for up to 10 years totalling up to $500,000 if their child has a severe condition that requires long-term caregiving Gives powerful peace of mind and shows all employees their employer ""has their back"" in the moments that matter for an unmet need in our society  The business case for Juno  Fills a financial protection gap for every current and future parent   Highly valued and unique benefit 90% of surveyed employees (both parents and non-parents) say they would want Protects the business by improving productivity and retention for impacted parents in a way that is ethical, fair, and consistent Enhances benefit equity and complements state paid family leave (PFL), company caregiver leave, and return to work programs  ",2,250 U.S. employees,"Juno is company-paid, group insurance.

All employees are automatically enrolled, and we cover all dependent children up to age 26, including adopted, step, foster, or grandchildren regardless of medical enrollment status.  This model allows for everyone to benefit from Juno's insurance protection without having to think about it.

Leveraging 8 years of helping customers build over $3B in savings, Stash is now also partnering with employers to make it easy and fun for their employees to save money.   For most people saving money is hard and feels out of reach. Lack of meaningful savings creates stress and impacts employees’ physical, mental, and professional well-being. StashWorks solves this problem - giving employees the ability to automatically deduct money from their paychecks, effortlessly save for life goals, and earn cash rewards for making consistent contributions and hitting “savings streaks.”  With no minimum balance or contribution requirements, no fee banking services, and no AUM fees, StashWorks makes it easy to get started and stick with it for the long run.  We’re fully integrated with all major payroll systems, ensuring a set up that takes just minutes for employers and employees.    Nearly 90% of working Americans saying they would participate in a workplace savings tool and 60% saying they’d be more likely to stay at a job that offered financial wellness benefits - StashWorks is on a mission to become the most utilized benefit and effective employee engagement solution.     What makes us different?  Combination of education and action: Unlike most providers in the financial benefits space, StashWorks offers both financial education and actionable accounts, tools and solutions. We call it “earn as you learn” and the experience is designed to help users utilize our financial content to take empowered, informed actions based on learnings.   Focus on savings and investing, accessible funds and portable accounts:  Across every segment of the population, people are most concerned about the amount  of money they have saved for emergencies. To this end, unlike many other providers in the space employees can choose from a variety of products and solutions including, savings and investing as well as retirement planning. In addition, we have integrations with all major payroll providers and can power automatic deductions from employees’ paychecks for deposit into a Stash account. Stash accounts move with employees so there is no work for employers to facilitate transitions. Whether employees are just surviving or thriving, Stash puts employees in the driver’s seat and gives them choice, access to their funds, and ease of portability.   Innovative, attractive rewards:  StashWorks is a first of its kind benefit that offers innovative rewards through sign up incentives, milestone rewards (i.e “savings streaks”) and spend based perks all with the goal of providing near term and long term value, encouraging enrollment and optimizing for long term engagement.    The rewards are branded, positioned and messaged as a ‘perk’ and convey a sense of optimism, levity and ‘value’ (i.e. a smart way to get ahead in life). The goal is to leverage a rewards driven experience to help turn money into a source of hope and opportunity.

We are highly committed to a culturally centered model of mental health, which means that we want to center on each unique company’s and person’s well-being. Our internal Clinical Strategy and Research team includes DEIB experts who focus on the care we provide to our members and how we source and educate providers.    Moreover, we consult with external experts in order to augment our internal expertise, including our Global Inclusion Council (GIC), a group of our own providers who provide care around the world and who have specialized expertise related to mental health equity, diversity, and culturally centered mental health care. The GIC provides expertise on a wide variety of topics, including things like how best to engage people in different regions, how risk of self-harm is handled in a given culture, or translation of clinical materials for our members.    For each member, we offer services that account for their own multifaceted culture, the cultures they exist within (for example, their employer or their geographic location), Modern Health’s culture, and the care providers’ cultures.    For our provider network, we aim to offer our members a broad range of providers who both specialize in serving people like them and can identify with their lived experiences. While we understand that a shared identity with a provider may be important for some, we also know that cultural identity is complex and adjusts across situations and time. With this in mind, we take a multi-prong approach in sourcing our network and matching members:    First, we're always working to increase the diversity of our network of therapists and coaches across a broad spectrum of specializations, expertise, and cultural identifications (such as race, nationality, and languages spoken).    Second, we also look for providers who have specialized training and experience serving diverse populations, and we are continuing to increase provider training on cultural humility and competence, which allows us to meet an individual’s needs as they change and allows providers to flexibly serve the whole person.    Third, when specific requests are made that we can’t fulfill from our existing network, we can “reactively” source a provider (for example, someone may request a therapist in a specific city who identifies as Latinx and who specializes in working with LGBTQ+ people).    Finally, and as noted, we actively work with our providers in order to make continuous improvements in our care model and offerings. Through all of these efforts, we are constantly working to improve how we source, support, and educate providers, as well as how to make our product and platform more welcoming and inclusive for all people. This work is also intended to increase our internal capacity to ensure that we are a leader in the DEIB space and that this is seen as the work of all teams at Modern Health.

Specifically, we view our therapy services as short-term and do not believe they constitute a significant benefit in the nature of medical care. As a result, we think that it’s reasonable for our customers to continue to treat such care as an accepted benefit under applicable federal regulations.   In addition, Modern Health does not offer therapy benefits in coordination with the employer's group health plan. That is, the arrangements Modern Health concludes with employers do not require employees to exhaust the benefits provided through its platform before employees are able to access benefits through their group health plan, nor does Modern Health structure its arrangements to make its benefits dependent on participation in another group health plan. Further, Modern Health does not charge any premiums to, or require any contributions from, employees to access these benefits. Finally, Modern Health does not impose any cost-sharing requirements, such as co-pays, in providing these benefits.   With regard to psychiatric/prescribing care, most customers offer these benefits as a wrap plan to ensure compliance with federal regulations.",,1,"Modern Health’s benefit is subject to COBRA. For COBRA, Modern Health has continued to provide benefits to COBRA participants through different mechanisms, such as under the terms of the arrangement at the employer’s expense. That said, we are cognizant of the requirements imposed on employers under COBRA with respect to continuing coverage, including certain nuances associated with an EAP-type benefit, and would be willing to work with customers to help them address these requirements.     Because most customers cover the full cost of the Modern Health benefit through a PEPM pricing model, we have developed an approach that enables an employee who wishes to continue the Modern Health benefit following a COBRA-qualifying event/termination of employment to elect COBRA continuation coverage and to pay the PEPM amount on a monthly basis during the COBRA period.   Because COBRA requires a group health plan to charge a COBRA-eligible employee no more than 102% of the premium charged for the employee’s plan benefits before such employee experiences a COBRA-qualifying event, Modern Health has only required an employee who elects COBRA coverage to pay during the coverage period the same PEPM amount that the employer had been paying.   For certain existing customers, Modern Health has continued to provide benefits to COBRA participants under the terms of the arrangement at the employer’s expense.  That said, we are cognizant of the requirements imposed on employers under COBRA with respect to continuing coverage, including certain nuances associated with an EAP-type benefit, and would be willing to work with employers to help them comply with these requirements.

Members love it too! Goodpath care has both the highest enrollment and engagement rates, driving truly equitable care for all.   Employers want a single solution that can address many conditions, that will impact a large portion of their population, and drive high impact. And they want a solution that fits within their budget. Goodpath has cracked the code on providing a single platform for the most common and costly conditions, using utilization based pricing to keep costs reasonable while also guaranteeing an ROI through a claims analysis and reduction in disability. This value based approach works for employers who have been unsatisfied with current singular point solutions in the market that drive minimal enrollments and are costly.   Goodpath is the first service that combines personalized digital care with physical products and medically-degreed coaches that both educate employees and enable them to execute their personalized care plans. Programs start with a dynamic, digital health assessment that helps us understand every member's medical condition and their willingness to change, goals, and preferences. Through both AI and human review, a uniquely personalized program is created for each member. Evidence-based treatments in our program include physical therapy, mind-body techniques, educational materials, cognitive behavioral therapy, and OTCs, devices, and other physical items that provide symptom relief.  Goodpath's whole person care approach is unique in the following ways:  1. Employee experience: Employees get access to personalized and complete care that targets the chief complaint (such as back pain) and the contributing factors (e.g. poor sleep, stress, diet) with proven treatments in one simple location. Because it's designed for them, it works for employees - leading to Goodpath's enrollment rates of 14% or greater 2. Depth of care: Goodpath care model follows the evidence-based practice of integrative health, making multi-disciplinary care accessible to all and uniquely bringing the breadth and depth of medicine needed to care for complex chronic conditions 3. Diversity, equity and inclusion: Employees have a voice in their care journey.  Program and coaching preferences are honored for  ethnicity, language, gender - culturally specific guidance; from nutrition plans to care kit contents and more.  4. Significant health improvement: Our average employee health improvement is 54%, absenteeism due to a health condition drops by 71%, and productivity increases by 53%. These results hold true for every 9 out 10 enrolled members, making it a powerful tool in employee happiness and retention. In addition, our member NPS says it all, acros our book of business, we measure it at 82 5. Cost reduction:Goodpath impacts a population at scale, which leads to significant cost reductions. This unique approach leads to industry-leading enrollment (14%+), strong employer ROI (3.1x), and healthier employees (85% see significant improvement in physical and mental health). In addition, across employers, we've measured a 30-50% reduction in incidence of short term disability as a result of rolling out Goodpath  For mental health, Goodpath is able to address a far larger share of people with mental health issues. Only 25% of people with a mental health condition actually seek care (either with talk therapy or self-directed - both of which Goodpath addresses). However, the remaining 75% of people with a mental health condition only ever seek care for physical conditions. With Goodpath, we address this """"missing majority"""" because they come to us for physical health issues (e.g. MSK, Digestive, Sleep) and through our digital health assessment and integrative approach, we can discover and address their mental health issues at the same time. This results in a significant and measurable increase in the number and severity of mental health conditions that Goodpath addresses relative to mental health-only solutions.  For cancer survivorship, our aim is to improve quality of life. While we don't diagnose or treat the cancer itself, we help with the mental health, sleep, diet, and/or pain issues around having and surviving cancer, as well as the common side effects from cancer medication (e.g. digestive issues, sleep issues, joint issues). Our medical coaches and licensed pharmacists guide members through whole-person care that improves quality of life outcomes.  Finally, Goodpath impacts an employer's entire risk profile: from intervening early with proven reductions in health claims and incidence of disability, to treating employees on absence which reduces the duration and severity of disability.",2,"1,000 Employees","We price at $850 per participant per year / case rate.

For our members, we personalize every part of their program and pair them with a dedicated health coach who is a resource for them at every step. This could mean creating specialized diets, extending coaching calls for 2 hours to help a member through turbulent periods, etc. We see this approach validated in our 100% coaching satisfaction rate and industry-busting NPS of 82.  For our clients, we personalize the experience for them as well, from a custom communication approach for their populations, to regular check-ins, even to how we structure the agreement - where we have guaranteed health savings and health outcomes.

All communications are customized for each client, including their branding and specific communication styles/languages.  We can tailor our communications in a variety of ways: Use different communication methods and messages for different workforces, e.g. email is very effective for corporate employees but SMS is much more effective for manufacturing employees Target communications and messaging to specific populations - e.g. high cost claimants Change messaging based on region  2. To members who have enrolled in our programs: For members, we have reminders, notifications, and status messages that are set as a standard part of any program.

Every family should have access to quality, affordable care quickly and safely, and our goal is to make that possibility a reality. We aspire to have the best technology and the biggest array of solutions available so every family can easily access the care they need—no matter when, where, and how they need it, and regardless of social or economic status.  Care's mission is to help families find the care they need, wherever, however, and whenever they need it. We’re disruptors aiming to change the world, one family at a time. We’re focused obsessively on building better care solutions for families. Below, we have provided our Care values that support this mission:  Accountability: We are passionate about the work that we do and strive to make a positive impact on our customers. We aren’t intimidated by any challenge and we jump on opportunities to take action and drive excellent results. When we own our stuff, we are self-motivated to take the lead and see things through. We remain focused and persistent.  Trust & Integrity: We believe relationships are built on trust and integrity. It is central to a successful business. When we each show personal integrity, we will be trusted and given the reins to lead. Without trust, there is very little we can accomplish that is worthwhile. Experimentation: Change is an inevitable constant, but our approach is thoughtful and planned. Creating purposeful change that sticks requires us to influence and persuade others to see things differently and we must have the courage to take risks and challenge the status quo. We embrace change by having an open mind, an ability to adapt on the fly and demonstrating a willingness to do something in a new and different way. We are agile and resilient, even in the face of uncertainty.  Product Stickiness: We are broad thinkers- driven by curiosity and a passion to solve problems. We understand things aren’t always what they seem to be, and we keep an open mind to dive in, ask questions and peel back the layers to truly understand what’s going on. We are interdisciplinary thinkers and have a growth mindset. We value different perspectives and embrace our similarities and differences to resolve complex business challenges and foster meaningful relationships.  Leadership: We are all leaders. Whether you are a leader of self, or a leader of others, we are all empowered to reach our full potential. We believe in setting clear paths, providing direct coaching and inspiring all employees to do their best and we hold ourselves accountable for both our successes and failures.","When working with Care for Business, new clients will be assigned a dedicated Account Manager who has years of experience in account management.

Phase 2: Communication materials will be provided to you and continue working with our team on the development of your eligibility file. Your dedicated company website will also be created at this time.    Phase 3: Before launch, we will finalize the eligibility file development with SFTP connectivity testing and put the eligibility product file into place. We’ll host a webinar for internal HR and key stakeholders to learn about the benefit prior to launch. Pre-identified “early users” will enroll in your dedicated website for final testing.    Launch: On launch day, we will make sure you’re armed with FAQs and communication materials to raise awareness about the benefits and to help employees enroll.

For optimal convenience, we can communicate directly with eligible members via email and promotions.

Care for Business personalizes our outreach efforts to ensure each enrolled member receives timely and relevant communications. To achieve this, we target and tailor the content of our messaging to deliver the most relevant themes for the products the member is eligible to receive from their employer. We also use this same approach for trigger communications. Specifically, in our welcome onboarding series, we guide newly enrolled members through up to four emails that are customized based on the benefit mix their employer provides to them. This series has clear logic that will show Backup Care-focused messaging, or Care Membership messaging only if Backup Care is not offered.

This is the option we recommend as it provides the most flexibility for the employee, makes enrolling and logging in quickly & easy, and most importantly, provides optimal security.   (2) SSO Only: With this option, employees must authenticate via SSO to enroll and log into the Care platform.   (3) Direct Registration only: With this option, clients can opt-out of SSO. This means their employees will only be able to log in using the username and password they create during enrollment.","A broad range of reports and real-time program performance data are accessible 24x7 via the Care Enterprise HR dashboard, available to those with administrator privileges.

Calm has 7 localized languages: English, German, Spanish, French, Korean, Portuguese, Japanese. We have real, recognized people narrating our stories to help normalize mental health. Some examples include: Harry Styles, Matthew Mcconaughey, Bridgerton’s Rege Jean-Page, Idris Elba, Laura Dern, Kate Winslet, Lucy Liu, Professor Megan Reitz, Jay Shetty, & Jeff Warren. An important nuance about Calm narrators is the idea that hearing from someone relatable further lowers that stigma. One prime example: we worked with Lama Rod Owens to create a Coming Out meditation series to support the LGBTQ+ community - where he shares from a place of expertise AND cross sections of his own life being a queer, black buddhist teacher.  We offer a variety of tools and content formats to meet people wherever they are in their mental health needs (we are so much more than meditations!). At its core, Calm’s content and variety of formats of delivery are what make it easy for people to get started and entice them to continue coming back.

Our tailored programs are designed to ensure a successful program launch, maintain high utilization, and provide relevant information to employees when they need it most. the client’s program can include the following communication efforts: •	Program Launch Campaigns—Launch communications are designed to introduce employees and managers to the GuidanceResources program and its many benefits. They also present important information regarding eligibility and the confidential nature of the program. Communication vehicles may include posters, brochures, wallet cards and digital outreach campaigns, and will highlight all program features from clinical counseling, to legal, financial and work-life services. It is important that participants know that GuidanceResources is more than just counselling, and that it has something for everyone.  •	Ongoing Engagement Tools—ComPsych will continually support the client’s GuidanceResources program with a steady stream of topical communications to keep the program top of mind for employees. During implementation, we will develop an annual communications calendar around specific needs, promoting engagement and driving utilization by addressing employees’ most pressing issues. For example, January’s campaign topic might be resiliency, where we would provide a series of posters, Helpsheets and employee trainings tailored to individuals dealing with stress and burnout issues, while February might focus on financial wellness or mental health awareness. Our campaigns are supported by the more than 90 informational learning sessions made available to customers. •	Themed Communication Campaigns—ComPsych’s highly responsive programs include the development of standalone campaigns tailored to the specific needs of each customer. For example, for customers going through change and/or reorganization, we have developed customer-specific resiliency and mindfulness training programs and Helpsheets. For customers seeking to improve organizational efficiency, we have delivered campaigns around thoughtful time management. ComPsych can also develop campaigns based on the top presenting issues among the client’s employee populations, top requested work-life resources or industry trends around employment, behavioral health and work-life balance.   All of our communication strategies, campaigns and resources can be easily integrated into existing internal communication schedules and calendars, or can be rolled out as standalone plans.

ThrivePass will provide a utilization file/report back to the employer on monthly (or weekly) basis with all of the employees who have utilized funds in the prior month (or week) along with the dollar amount utilized, and the category.

","Espresa recommends focusing on employee participation in the program as one of the primary measures of success and employee value. When designing your program, Espresa will work with clients to help them understand which program options best meet their needs and help guide you in creating a program that achieves 85% to 95% participation.  In our experience, key elements to driving employee value revolve around program design, communication, creating a friction-free experience, monitoring performance, and adjusting the program over time to ensure it meets the needs of employees and the company.   During implementation, we work with clients to design and configure programs that meet their objectives and create the user experience you desire for employees, which will achieve the participation goals theyset.  Espresa has a finely tuned communication plan to maximize employee awareness and participation. The key is to strike a balance between overcommunication - which will get tuned out - and under-communication, which will result in poor awareness and participation. For example, a typical plan includes a variety of launch communications. Then periodic communications targeted to specific audiences (e.g., people who have never logged into Espresa, people who have logged in but never filed a claim, etc.) and end-of-plan reminder comms. Although plans are customized for each client, common communication channels include virtual/onsite benefit fairs, employee town halls/webinars, internal newsletters, leadership announcements, blog posts, recorded videos, slack, etc.  Ongoing, Espresa leverages in-platform analytics to understand program dynamics and share insights that inform ongoing engagement needs and strategy.",F_3qxM1c6eQO2mBBT,Espresa Sample Communication Plan + Samples (1).pdf,4333059,application/pdf,"Espresa believes diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are at the core of who we need to be as a people globally.

Our provider network is 84% female, 41% non-white, and about 20% of our providers speak a language other than English. Lyra connects members to the providers who can best meet their needs. To ensure consistent, industry-leading outcomes, we also have clinical oversight of our network. Before a provider is added, they are vetted extensively. We look for cultural competencies, evidence-based treatments, and credentials. We monitor providers on an ongoing basis to verify that our standards are being met. Owning our network allows us to make sure patients are getting better. We also provide training and support to our providers.

Support Fees: We charge a flat support PEPM fee to cover the use of Lyra's unique digital platform. Our platform provides personalized care recommendations and online appointment scheduling, active network management to deliver evidence-based care, dedicated account management, and innovative quarterly marketing resources.

Training on being an anti-oppressive therapist working with LGBTQIA+ individuals and people of color. Training in working with transgender clients. Culturally responsive support for Black men. Getting parents ready to talk about race. Training in the social justice implications for evidence-based treatments. Training in understanding white privilege and allyship in therapy.

The underpinning to our solution is innovation. Carrot has been the first to market in new service offerings including gestational surrogacy, donor coverage, and menopause support - leading the marketplace through healthcare innovation, and setting the bar high for our competition to follow. Our end-to-end suite of services does not sacrifice the depth we’ve built up over the years of solidifying our stronghold as an expert in family-forming and hormonal health care. What differentiates us from other vendors in the space is:  First, our approach. We believe that fertility is inclusive of women but also broader. It is a fundamental part of human healthcare spanning every age, sex, gender, and more. To serve women best, we must enable everyone - not only females -  to engage in their fertility health. As the category enters its mainstream growth phase, we see this continued maturation happening across the U.S. and around the globe so that fertility is no longer a woman's fault, responsibility, or burden. All people can engage and take part in the benefits and burdens of how we pursue parenthood.   Second, our experience and data. Our fertility dataset is orders of magnitude larger than anyone else's. Sequoia clients everywhere will benefit from tens of millions of data points across 130 countries, generated by tens of thousands of members who have gone down similar paths before, all to ensure a premier member experience. No one else has the depth, range, and, importantly, confident command of this highly dynamic fertility landscape. Experience and data matter, especially when handling topics as sensitive as infertility, pregnancy, hormonal health, and more.   Third, our people. Data, clinical rigor, and technology are enablers of human beings who are at the heart of how we support members. We know the power of human connection and expert empathy is what truly moves the needle with members, whether it's by helping to educate them on the nuances of laws that may not be black and white or simply being a quiet listener during a time of intense grief, We are right there with you. These are the moments that members remember -- and ones that will make them think to themselves and say out loud to others, ""My company supported me during one of the most important times of my life, and I'll never forget it."" It’s important not only that members engage with Carrot, but that they are highly satisfied with it. With our solution, members are offered unlimited touch points with their Care Navigator, as the Care Navigator supports them through every aspect of the journey, from education to clinic matching, from benefits coverage to financial services, and more. Additionally, our members are provided with 1:1 support with our full suite of Carrot Experts for supplementary resources, education, and support throughout every step of their journey. Carrot is the leading provider of high-touch employee support for lifelong fertility and family-forming care, and our superior member satisfaction demonstrates this.",2,No,"Over 250 Employees: Sequoia  clients with 250+ employees have the option to purchase Carrot through a PEPM model or a utilization based model.   - PEPM Pricing Model - In this model employers pay Carrot a per employee per month fee  - Utilization Pricing Model: Carrot charges a low, up-front annual fee based on a PEPY model that covers program support through a designated Customer Success Manager (CSM), reporting throughout the year, and launch support. This fee also covers members and their partners who want to access the platform's educational content and learn more about the Carrot benefit and family forming. In many cases a Sequoia discount applies to the case rate.  When a member becomes meaningfully engaged and is ready to move forward with their family-building path, a custom Carrot Plan is created for that member to promote the healthiest possible outcome. Carrot Plans include unlimited access to Carrot Experts and support from a Care Navigator who works with employees through every step of their journey. Carrot Plans are then charged/available for a 12-month period and include access for spouses and domestic partners.  $X upfront admin fee + case rate ($X estimated) = annual total spend  **Please note that Carrot offers tiered support (Carrot Core vs Carrot Pro), allowing employers to choose whether offering a financial benefit aligns with their organizational goals and capabilities. If our employer customer chooses to offer their employees a financial benefit (Carrot Pro), we partner with them to custom-design a benefit allowance using industry benchmarking and best practices. The annual total spend will differ based on which tier of coverage the customer chooses.  Under 250 Employees: For employers in this market segment, Carrot has a flat annual administration fee (of $25,000) for either Carrot Core or Carrot Pro. Similar to as described above, if our employer customer chooses to offer their employees a financial benefit (Carrot Pro), we partner with them to custom-design a benefit allowance using industry benchmarking and best practices.

Members who have Carrot Rx fertility medication coverage can access a pharmacy clinician for any questions related to medications and administration on a 24/7/365 basis. And, members always have 24/7/365 access to the Carrot member platform, which includes educational articles, guides, and videos, as well as a real-time overview of the member's specific benefit and details on their unique family-forming journey. ","Carrot believes that customer success is built in providing a multi-tiered approach to customer support. Once the MSA has been fully executed, Carrot will engage the Customer Success team to begin the implementation process and drive toward a successful launch of the Carrot program to employees. The Carrot Customer Success team will ""quarterback"" all initial setup activities (including operational readiness activities such as compliance and reporting).   Following the launch of the Carrot program, the Customer Success team will continue to oversee the account and ensure expectations are met or exceeded over the course of the relationship. The team approach ensures continuity and fluidity of service in the event of a Carrot employee's transition from the team or the organization. The Carrot Customer Success team is supported by a team of product, technical, and clinical subject matter experts who may be engaged as needed.","Experts Carrot's multi-disciplinary team of Medical Experts is a team of licensed clinical and non-clinical experts that include OB/GYNs, reproductive endocrinologists, urologists, embryologists, nurses, midwives, doulas, lactation consultants, nutritionists, social workers, mental health professionals, and more. Medical experts must have an active clinical license (this requires continuous education to maintain a license), as well as all necessary credentials required for their specialty. Carrot Experts typically have a minimum of two years of experience in their role. They are provided with ongoing education by Carrot and are involved in discussions related to industry advancements, changes in legislation, and developments in practice. Our members can opt to schedule a chat with a specialized Carrot Expert, providing members with the opportunity to ask questions related to medical, emotional, and family-forming scenarios. The chats are educational in nature, and our experts may provide medical or family-forming advice and recommendations during these sessions; note that these sessions are not intended to be a substitute for medical or legal services.  Members have unlimited support from full-time registered nurses (RNs) whose main function includes member interactions and education as well as a full suite of clinical/medical contractors globally (MD, RN, PhD, MS, Midwife, etc.).  Care Navigation Care Navigators are experienced, healthcare industry veterans and are trained through a curriculum designed by Carrot's Chief Medical Officer, Chief Scientific Advisor, and member success leadership. To be eligible for hire, Care Navigators must have strong customer service experience in healthcare, a bachelor's degree or equivalent work experience, and a specific skill set (empathy, attention to detail, problem-solving skills) that is tested through a series of situational interviews and performance exercises. Once hired, Care Navigators complete initial training including two weeks of intensive learning on family-forming topics, Carrot's product and services, empathy and sensitivity, LGBTQ+ community support, and more. Care Navigators then participate in a two-week program shadowing seasoned Care Navigators before entering a hybrid period with care navigation management where all communications are reviewed prior to interacting with their first Carrot member. All members of the Care Navigation team complete ongoing training on Carrot's products and services, basic refresher training, and annual education on privacy and security compliance.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,70,,"Carrot strives to make the implementation process as seamless as possible for customers. Implementation is led by the Carrot Implementation Manager (IM) who facilitates regular communication while providing guidance along the way on key business decisions, employee communications, Carrot and customer deliverables, technical setup, joint testing, acceptance, and operational readiness (including compliance, reimbursement and tax handling processes, and reporting/analytics).   In our experience, we have seen the greatest success with implementation when customers assign a Project Manager or Project Lead to facilitate communication within the customer's organization and interface directly with the Carrot IM. Additionally, we recommend engaging available subject matter experts in the areas of finance and compliance.   Leading up to the implementation kickoff meeting, Carrot will provide visibility into the key decisions and discussion topics to ensure customers can responsibly engage the appropriate roles/players/resources within their organization. Carrot understands the importance of collaborating upfront regarding resources required, the time commitment needed, responsiveness norms, and availability for recurring and ad-hoc meetings.   During the kickoff meeting, the Carrot IM provides an in-depth walkthrough of the entire implementation process. Additionally, Carrot has developed an Implementation Playbook to help guide customers through the process which will be shared prior to the implementation kickoff meeting.

We understand that each member has unique needs related to the family-forming journey and interactions with Carrot. With this in mind, we offer multiple options for members to engage with Carrot staff so that each member can choose the option(s) that is best suited to their individual needs.   These communication methods accommodate members who prefer a self-service model, and those who appreciate having more direct support from Carrot's team of experts. When a member initially goes through onboarding with Carrot, they are assigned to a Care Navigator. The Care Navigator will proactively reach out to the member via email, and will also offer to set up an audio or video chat if those communication methods are member-preferred. For subsequent support outside of the member's regular communication with their Care Navigator, members can reach Carrot via email, asynchronous chats, as well as audio and video Telehealth support.  Carrot proactively engages and re-engages members based on user actions and appropriate brand marketing. Carrot provides meaningful messaging and experiences for our members in order to drive engagement and enrollment. This includes:  - Welcome emails - New member webinar invites - Reachback emails sent to anyone who registered but did not create a Carrot Plan - Reachback emails based on user responses during registration - Infertility awareness emails for unregistered eligible employees - Carrot Plan abandonment email  Our communications are written from an employee-first perspective, leveraging user insights. We utilize user segments to target communications based on member journeys, characteristics, and circumstances (leveraging reimbursement data, user behavior, and content interests). Future state, we will be implementing a new communications process that allows members to select specific content areas of interest to further provide them with communications relevant to their needs and goals, when they need it - reducing noise so members are more likely to receive communications that earn their attention and propel action.",,,,,"At Carrot, DEI are foundational to our success as a company.

Each service offering is available on a stand-alone basis. Our suite of solutions include:  Family Planning (Fertility Testing, Early interventions, Cryopreservation, etc) Fertility Adoption Gestational surrogacy Pregnancy, postpartum, & early parenting support Menopause and low testosterone support Gender-Affirming Care (GAC)  Family planning: Oftentimes, members know they want to grow their family but are unsure where to start, or they've encountered challenges and need guidance to move forward. When a member is ready to begin their family-forming journey with Carrot, they are matched with a personal Care Navigator who will then create a Carrot Plan unique to the member's needs — bringing Carrot resources together in a step-by-step guide that helps members reach their specific family-forming goals.   Carrot empowers our members to start their family-forming journey with less invasive, less expensive, first-line interventions before stepping foot in a fertility clinic. These interventions include precision ovulation tracking, nutrition counseling, and options for at-home support. A fundamental piece of Carrot’s solution is to support our members even as they begin thinking about family formation versus supporting them only when they are struggling. We do not want to fast-track people into IVF; in fact, we give our members and employer partners a wide range of options and support before costly, invasive IVF surgery. Carrot provides financial coverage and care navigation services for members who wish to preserve their fertility (egg, sperm, embryo freezing). We guide members in making a choice that works for their individual journey and will navigate them to in-clinic options as well as our clinical-grade, at-home sperm analysis and cryopreservation services (as appropriate).   Fertility: Our fertility care solution takes a clinically managed approach to fertility support, leveraging our own highly vetted network to drive members to top-quality fertility clinics. We take a proactive approach to education, ensuring members are aware of and understand best practices. Additionally, we are the only solution that provides utilization management of multiple embryo transfers (MET) — ensuring an increased number of single embryo transfer (SET) cases, which leads to proven healthier outcomes. As part of our solution, Carrot covers the following fertility-related services for all applicable members and their partners: basic fertility testing (including labs, bloodwork, and ultrasounds); intrauterine insemination (IUI); in-vitro fertilization (IVF); reciprocal IVF (for same-sex female couples); preservation services (egg, sperm, embryo freezing); and urology visits (for male infertility).   Adoption: Our guiding principle has and will continue to be to support legal, safe, and ethical adoption practices that promote safety, stability, and permanence in the best interests of children. We provide support, education, and guidance for our members, including our LGBTQ+ members for and throughout the adoption, keenly focused on the types of adoption, explanations, and costs by country and region. This entails respective Adoption agencies, agency fees, travel expenses, court and legal fees, mental health screenings, and other related eligible fees. The Carrot financial benefit can also be used to cover eligible expenses for adoption journeys, both domestic and intercountry, where legally permissible. We recognize that access to care through the lens of laws and regulations is complex and may vary based on factors such as location, marital status, and sexual orientation.  Gestational Surrogacy: A gestational surrogacy journey support is a complex and emotional journey for our global members. At the core is to ensure a premier member experience, highly educated on the process, and to provide access to quality experts supporting our members. We vet and partner with agencies that provide the guidance, support, and tools for intended parents to use a gestational carrier/surrogate to have a child. We understand there are complexities worldwide and by region we will support cultural and regulatory appropriateness. Where appropriate Carrot will support reimbursement for agency fees, egg/sperm retrieval or freezing, medications, donor reimbursement, egg/sperm bank fees, and much more.   Pregnancy, Postpartum, & Parenting: Carrot is designed to support members from exploration through postpartum and transitioning back to work.   Maternal healthcare is at a critical juncture and Carrot is focused on ensuring engagement and trust are factored into every interaction with our members. We know that family forming and maternity can be challenging for many with 1 in 6 people globally affected by infertility and 1 in 10 babies born prematurely in the U.S. Lack of access to quality care is resulting in increasing costs and poor health outcomes, which impacts member engagement, customer retention, and growth, as well as your bottom line. We know this data is skewed on a global basis which is why the Carrot program for maternity focuses on a multi-pronged approach.  Create a concierge-level member experience through education, guidance, and care management. Address equity by matching our members to clinical experts who share the same race and cultural background as they are to ensure we are building trust throughout their journey and adherence to recommendations.  Members in the postpartum period transitioning back to work benefit from existing Carrot offerings. In fact, 9 out of 10 members who have Carrot Plans for a pregnancy journey return to work after they give birth. Through our high-touch care navigation, access to our full suite of postpartum Carrot Experts, and our extensive library of digital resources, we help to ensure members achieve safer, healthier outcomes and receive support to promote their physical and emotional well-being at every stage. Following a birth, members remain engaged with their Care Team (if they choose), including care navigation and extensive Telehealth support which includes unlimited access to OB/GYNs, mental health professionals who specialize in postpartum depression and anxiety, lactation consultants, doulas, midwives, and nutritionists when needed.    As part of Carrot's pregnancy support, members can access: - Expert-led, intimate group sessions with a specific focus on postpartum topics - Unlimited chats with Carrot experts including doulas, midwives, OB/GYNs, and lactation consultants. Members can also speak to emotional support experts about managing stress and anxiety. - Financial coverage for in-person doulas who can provide postpartum support  - Financial support for milk shipping - Self-guided educational resources on postpartum topics, such as lactation and postpartum depression  Our solution is built to provide our members with the education, resources, and support necessary to confidently transition back to their careers when the time comes. Additionally, Carrot's interactive benefits ecosystem allows us to partner with an employer's parental support vendors and provide warm transfers for our members if they are in need of these services.  Menopause and low testosterone: Fertility hormones are at the center of fertility care. Carrot understands that the same key hormones that govern whether IVF, egg freezing, or pregnancy will be successful also govern another important part of fertility care, which is hormonal aging. That's why fertility support isn’t just pertinent in someone’s reproductive years — it is important throughout life. Carrot uniquely provides clinically-validated, complete support for people in managing symptoms associated with menopause and low testosterone (low T), including access to resources such as expert-guided group sessions to build a community with Carrot members who are on a similar journey timeline as well as self-serve content such as articles and dynamic guides, allowing members to learn at their own pace when that’s the right approach. Members can find specialized providers that support menopause and low T through Carrot's vetted provider list or work with their Care Navigator for support on finding the best provider that works for their situation. In addition, members can use employer-sponsored funds for covered expenses, including hormone replacement therapy and visits with specialists.   Many of these employees in their 40s and 50s are incredibly valuable leaders, managers, and executives on your team. The result is lost productivity at work, bouncing around the healthcare system, or suffering in silence. Equitable fertility care for all is including all sexes, sexual orientations, genders – and ages.   Gender-Affirming Care (GAC): Carrot provides holistic support, personalized navigation, and gender-affirming hormone therapy coverage for individuals seeking gender-affirming care (GAC). While GAC is currently offering in the US only, as the landscape and market shift to accomodate globally, so will Carrot in our global offering where appropriate for GAC coverage.

We work with our employer customers to determine their preferred tax posture and to support compliance with all legal requirements applicable to their health plan offerings. For individuals enrolled in employer-sponsored HDHPs, we follow the current IRS guidelines regarding minimum deductible amounts for self-only and family coverage when referencing the dollar amount that individuals must meet to satisfy their Carrot-specific deductible. We determine whether a deductible applies based on the member’s attestation when they create a Carrot account.  Carrot has years of experience processing payments for fertility coverage. For example, in the U.S., Carrot is structured as a post-deductible HRA to maintain HSA eligibility and we ask members to confirm medical plan enrollment prior to covering qualified medical expenses through the HRA.  Our platform helps navigate the complexities surrounding taxation as they relate to current ERISA interpretation. We send monthly reports that are reflective of the customer's tax posture and can be easily automated into the payroll system.",1,,"We provide tax reporting on a monthly basis to our employer partners that flags expenses as taxable vs. non-taxable, based on their preferred tax posture.

Approved content is pushed out through our Clinical Learning systems and TOPS communication tools, and incorporated into our regular clinical and operational practices. Since its inception, our Health Equity DWG has driven dozens of initiatives ranging from addressing Covid vaccine hesitancy to managing hypertension, renal disease and cancer screening in Black patients to best practices for using interpreters/translators in our patient encounters.

With Progyny, members are more likely to achieve their dream: a healthy baby. Progyny's comprehensive, equitable benefit allows members to pursue the most effective treatment and achieve optimal outcomes in a cost-efficient manner. This results in faster time to pregnancy, fewer miscarriages, and healthier singleton births, thereby reducing high-risk maternity and NICU expenses.   Network of directly contracted top providers. Progyny has curated the nation's largest network of top reproductive endocrinologists and reproductive urologists, including 950+ providers in 650+ locations and providing an unparalleled level of quality, access, and convenience for members. Progyny contracts and manages all of its providers, and has a continuous patient data exchange, enabling a transparent view into all outcomes so employers can see a true ROI, and member support can be clinically integrated with outbound support at key times of the family building journey.   Member-centric approach. Progyny provides personalized, dedicated support and top-quality care that helps members achieve better outcomes and reduce the stress that’s inherent in the fertility journey. Throughout their journey, members are supported by a dedicated PCA, who reaches out at key times to offer support, guidance, and resources via both phone, message and through digital companion tools. Members save time and stress – they never need to spend time in a doctor’s billing office or spending time seeing how much they can afford, as Progyny covers care in the same manner as employers cover other complex medical conditions. This also reduces the stigma around fertility, which can arise when it is provided with a dollar cap benefit. ",2,"The Progyny solution is available to self-insured employers with a minimum requirement of 1,000 benefit enrolled employees and fully insured employers with a minimum of 500 benefit eligible employees. ","Our fee structure is utilization-based to align price and value.    A nominal administrative population based PEPM fee is paid by the client to Progyny. This fee allows all members to use the services of Progyny’s Patient Care Advocates (PCAs), digital tools, and preconception support, regardless of whether they continue on to fertility treatment. Progyny’s services support all paths to family building, including support for the navigation of adoption and surrogacy. This also includes support for patients who do not progress to fertility treatments. Progyny’s experience is that 50% of members who engage with a PCA don’t move on to treatment.   The client pays for the actual utilization of fertility treatment services by its members. Progyny bills the employer for such services in accordance with Progyny’s unique bundled case rates, which vary by the service rendered and the clinic location. Progyny’s bundled case rates include all physician and laboratory fees and all of Progyny’s Care Management services (concierge PCA services, optimized plan design, network access and management, outcomes reporting, full-service account management, integrated fertility medication program, digital tools, etc.).   Progyny also offers the following add-on programs:  - Progyny menopause and midlife care is available as an add-on for a nominal $0.10 PEPM and $75-$250 per visit (member average ~3 visits).   - Progyny pregnancy and postpartum can be elected as an add on for a $500 case rate per engaged member annually, which includes support through pregnancy and 6 months postpartum.  -Progyny+ is available as an add-on for $110 per engaged participant per month, plus claims.

A member’s journey with Progyny begins with an initial call with a PCA onboarding specialist. Through our unique MemberMatch program, members are paired with their perfect PCA based on their individual needs, preferences, and situation. Progyny’s PCAs are nurses, doulas, embryologists, andrologists, clinical psychologists and other experts that are trained to provide members on their family building journey with education, clinical guidance and emotional support.    A member’s dedicated PCA verifies eligibility (in real-time) and activates the member on the Progyny Member Portal. After an initial onboarding conversation personalized to the member’s needs (typically 20+ minutes), they receive a comprehensive Progyny Member Guide for reference. Members who are trying to conceive are enrolled in our preconception program; for members that require treatment, the PCA will help the member navigate the fertility journey by first finding the right provider fit within our network of premier clinics. Members can also contact the provider directly or search on www.progyny.com/findaprovider.    Progyny members have access to our app and can reach their PCAs via phone and secure messaging. The member app includes educational articles and videos, as well as a real-time overview of the Progyny benefit and details on the member's fertility journey, Smart Cycle allowance, and out of pocket responsibility in one centralized location. Members can also schedule calls with their PCAs at a time that works well for them, and they can track their Rx deliveries in real time right to their doorstep.    A member's dedicated PCA leads their care team and can bring in additional PCAs to be part of a member's care team, including PCA doulas, surrogacy and adoption coaches, and clinical educators, depending on the member's fertility and family building journey and needs.  Members have over 15 interactions with their PCA during their treatment on average. PCAs help to educate members about the Progyny benefit as well as existing employer benefits; they assist with the coordination of appointments and records; they educate members throughout preconception, prenatal, pregnancy, and postpartum.    Progyny’s model is inbound and outbound, enhancing the member experience and ensuring continuity. The PCA proactively makes outbound outreach to check in with the member at critical points throughout the duration of treatment (e.g., when she begins her injections, after embryo transfer, or a pregnancy test result).   ","PCAs   Progyny’s PCAs are nurses, doulas, embryologists, andrologists, clinical psychologists and ​other experts who are trained to provide members on their family building journey with education, clinical guidance, and emotional support.

A client may elect to not renew the contract upon 90 days written notice effective at the end of the current term.  ","Over the past seven years, Progyny has created a best-in-class communications strategy that is customized for each client to optimize outreach and engagement. As part of our standard materials, Progyny provides a benefit overview flyer, cobranded benefit overview video, and the Progyny Member Guide. We also provide a digital postcard, which is an easy way to share customized materials with a client's employees. All of this is provided at no cost to the client.   Members receive the Progyny Member Guide when they activate their benefit with their dedicated PCA. This guide is customized to the client and provides all the information a member needs to utilize their benefit: specific coverage information, financial responsibilities, explanation of covered treatments and services, adoption and surrogacy reimbursement processes, Progyny Rx details, and frequently asked questions.    We recommend posting these materials on the company intranet if possible and sending them via email during open enrollment season. Both the flyer and video provide an introduction to the Progyny benefit and direct members to call their PCA.   We also recommend the following activities to increase awareness of a client's new comprehensive fertility and family building coverage:   - Send Progyny-provided email announcement introducing the benefits. We recommend sending to all eligible employees at go live and including the link to the digital postcard or benefit overview video.   - Send printed benefit announcement poster to all physical locations. These are displayed in breakrooms and spread general awareness about the Progyny benefit.   - Send cobranded postcard to 28–44-year-old employees on an eligible plan notifying them of their new benefits.   - Offer at least one benefit overview webinar. The 45-minute webinar goes over the Progyny benefit and client-specific coverage. It includes a Q+A section with a Progyny PCA so members can ask anonymous questions. Progyny provides a PDF poster with a registration link. We recommend including it in an email promoting the event ~3 weeks before. A recording will be available after the event.   - Offer a fertility 101 educational webinar featuring a network provider. Although we offer events on several different topics, we recommend starting with a fertility 101 event to educate members on the basics of fertility and family building, including an explanation of their Progyny coverage. The webinar includes a Q+A section with a local fertility specialist so members can ask anonymous questions. Progyny provides a PDF poster with a registration link. We recommend including it in an email promoting the event ~3 weeks before. A recording will be available after the event.   This communication strategy is reviewed during implementation and customized as needed.  ",F_2wz4VPd0Yivu4US,Progyny_Sample Member Materials.pdf,6096895,application/pdf,"The Progyny solution was designed to provide inclusive, comprehensive, and equitable care to support a diverse population. Our mission is to make everyone’s dream of parenthood come true through a healthy, timely, and supported fertility and family building journey.   Benefit design: The Progyny benefit helps reduce care inequities; for example, we do not require a medical diagnosis of infertility in order to access care. Contrary to our approach, traditional health plans typically require a medical diagnosis of infertility before allowing members access to treatment coverage. A medical diagnosis typically means six to twelve months of unsuccessful, unprotected, heterosexual intercourse. This requirement means LGBTQ+ individuals, LGBTQ+ couples, and single parents by choice are prohibited from accessing benefit coverage. We also cover tissue freezing that is beneficial for trans members who want to preserve fertility prior to beginning hormone therapy.   Race-related disparities in fertility and maternal health, especially among Black women, are also prevalent. Compared to white women, Black women are twice as likely to suffer from infertility but half as likely to access care, regardless of their socioeconomic status (CDC, 2014). While there are many reasons Black women may not be getting the care they need, Progyny understands that providing comprehensive coverage and access to high-quality care is a key step in reducing health disparities and helping members get the treatment they deserve. Progyny addresses racial and ethnic disparities by covering screening for monogenic disorders like Sickle Cell Disease (1 in 13 Black Americans of African descent carry the Sickle Cell trait), Tay Sachs, or Cystic Fibrosis.   Progyny’s benefit design utilizes the Smart Cycle instead of dollar-based plans, as dollar-based plans have been shown to drive inequities in care and fail to positively impact outcomes. Dollar-cap plans are not best practice for complex medical care. They can be discriminatory, burdensome for members, and ultimately cause an increase in total cost for the employer. For example, dollar-cap plans cause more stress and anxiety because they drive a scarcity mindset as members are required to fill out a financial attestation, spend time with billing coordinators, figure out how much services will cost, and keep track of care and cost all on their own. Additionally, dollar-based benefits are inequitable, as different people need different treatments, levels of medication, and based on their home geography, some people may be able to afford more treatment than others. Lastly, by covering fertility with a dollar-based benefit as opposed to covering it similarly to how employers cover other complex medical care, it furthers the stigma around fertility that it is “different.”     Member care and support: Our PCAs are trained to support cultural and racial diversity in their roles and are required to complete trainings from in-network Progyny providers on fertility and maternity within BIPOC and LGBTQ+ communities. Progyny's PCAs also provide resources to members, including referrals to community organizations who specialize in support for LGBTQ+, single parents by choice, and BIPOC individuals, such as The Broken Brown Egg (https://thebrokenbrownegg.org/). Members have the option to request a BIPOC PCA as well, and Progyny offers webinars and podcast episodes providing education, support, and guidance for diverse members, which can be found at: https://progyny.com/education/podcast     Similarly, Progyny’s network of fertility specialists – reproductive endocrinologists and reproductive urologists – are vetted to ensure they are providing culturally responsive care and LGBTQ+ inclusive services. Every quarter, we review outcomes for both a rolling 12-month and 24-month period and host a discussion with our providers on how they are trending as well as how they have performed compared to peers. Progyny’s Medical Advisory Board, comprised of leading reproductive endocrinologists across the US, ensures that our plan design recognizes the unique needs and cultural differences in approach to treatment that members might require.    A member’s dedicated PCA can assist them with finding an in-network provider who will meet their desired characteristics (including preferred gender, race, and language) and unique needs. To complement this personalized PCA support, we also have a robust provider search tool members can use. Members can access detailed information about providers and clinics, including demographic data, practice characteristics, specialties and areas of interest, languages spoken, and services available at the clinic. We are dedicated to empowering members to make the best choices for themselves – and this is much easier when you connect to and feel comfortable with your provider.   All support, guidance, and care is based on and tailored to the member's unique journey, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, racial identity, or personal care preferences.   Member communications and education: During implementation, Progyny will ensure that our communication strategies support a client’s diverse population. We regularly partner with our clients’ various Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to reach targeted populations likely to benefit from learning about their fertility and family building coverage. For example, we can bring a Progyny network provider in to discuss family building options specific to LGBTQ+ individuals, including reciprocal IVF and surrogacy. Progyny also provides ongoing curated member education (webinar, articles, blogs, podcasts, videos) throughout the year focused on various topics such as infertility in the BIPOC community or family building for LGBTQ+ and single parents by choice.   Corporate efforts: Progyny acknowledges that we cannot just focus on helping members build their families for today. Our work must also create a fair and just future. Health disparities in fertility and maternal health continue and we are dedicated to providing support to our staff, members, and employer clients to close the gaps. We are doing this through the establishment of Progyny's Social Justice Committee and Allies groups that inform not just our corporate strategy but our solution, dedicated training and education for our Member Services team, and targeted member education to enhance benefit awareness and access. Progyny publishes its CSR report (which can be found at https://investors.progyny.com/static-files/5654fe7d-3287-47d8-96ae-bfb0223fbb70). The report outlines the work Progyny is doing and its commitment to people, diversity, and inclusion.",2,"During the implementation process, Progyny will request a sample dataset from each health plan to test our eligibility connectivity through Availity. This testing is best practice, and the goal is to confirm that Progyny PCAs can submit a request for eligibility and receive a real-time response that includes eligibility and accumulators. ",,,,,,,,,1,"Although the Member Portal has the capability to support SSO to allow Member access via an Employee Portal or another vendor, the portal’s infrastructure supports only one method of authentication. Activating SSO prevents members from accessing the Member Portal via login page(member.progyny.com).   For employers who require SSO on the Portal, the following should also be considered:   - If SSO access for a Member to the Member Portal is terminated, the Member will no longer be able to access claims history using the Portal. The Member would be required to contact Progyny directly via email/phone.   - SSO may prevent members from using their preferred email address (e.g. personal email instead of work email).   - Members frequently prefer not to send their personal health information to their work email address.   - This creates a security vulnerability if employee email addresses are recycled.   - SSO through an employer intranet may prevent Dependent from accessing the Member Portal   - This creates privacy concerns as the users will lose control over who can access their personal health records. ","Progyny’s quarterly and annual client reporting is designed to give our clients a full view of how their fertility dollars are being utilized, clinical results, and member satisfaction. Beyond typical performance metrics, we provide details on a quarterly and annual basis that include:   - The overall utilization rate of the benefit and utilization rates by specific treatment type, including member average age   - Aggregate dollars spent on each treatment type and the average cost of each specific treatment   - Member satisfaction scores on Patient Care Advocate quality, the overall Progyny benefit, provider satisfaction, and Net Promoter Score (NPS)   - Detailed clinical outcomes by treatment type collected from actual medical records (rather than inferred from claims data)   - Utilization of key technologies, such as PGT-A (formerly called PGS) and single embryo transfer (SET)   - Patient volume by network clinic   Progyny is the only solution to receive actual outcomes from providers across our entire network. This detailed level of reporting allows clients to fully assess the value they are receiving from the Progyny program. Most importantly, they will understand the specific services they are paying for and what value they produce (in terms of clinical outcomes and member satisfaction). We believe we're the only fertility vendor offering performance guarantees based on outcomes (while many vendors offer none or only focus on customer service). We're able to do this because of our individualized treatment cycle reporting with providers.   On a yearly basis, Progyny will also convene an annual review that analyzes benefit utilization, treatment mix, spend, and outcomes. Member experience with both Progyny and providers will be shared and recommendations for future member communications will be discussed. The annual review culminates with a Summary of Value document that will enable the client's team to articulate how the Progyny benefit helped members meet their dreams of having a family, how it reduced spend, and how the benefit mitigated high-risk maternity and NICU claims. Progyny can also create ad hoc reports at no additional cost.    These reports are shared with clients by their Account Manager and cannot be pulled from an admin website.

We adhere to rigorous credentialing thresholds for inclusion in our network, and our network providers utilize the latest technologies and best practices. Our network includes 950+ providers in 650+ locations, providing an unparalleled level of quality, access, and convenience for members. Progyny also requires its network providers to directly submit treatment outcomes in real-time as actionable fertility treatment outcomes data cannot be accurately obtained from medical claims.    Concierge Patient Care Advocate (PCA) services starting with preconception support and coaching   Members are assigned a dedicated PCA who provides preconception and fertility guidance and emotional support throughout their entire journey to parenthood, including adoption and surrogacy. Progyny PCAs are reproductive health experts, registered nurses, and other fertility specialists trained to provide highly personalized service across each member’s unique fertility and family-building journey (including surrogacy and adoption). Coaching and guidance starts with a robust preconception program, enabling members to achieve healthy pregnancies. On average, PCAs engage with a member over 15 times during treatment. Progyny PCAs achieve a world-class Net Promoter Score (NPS) of +82. If a member does require fertility care, their PCA continues supporting them throughout their entire journey.    Comprehensive and equitable plan design    Our innovative fertility benefit design simplifies the member experience and provides access to state-of-the-art treatment options without any barriers to accessing care. The Smart Cycle is Progyny’s easy-to-understand benefit currency, supporting all paths to parenthood (including adoption, surrogacy, donor tissue, single parents by choice, etc.) Unlike traditional fee-for-service carrier models, everything needed for a comprehensive fertility treatment is bundled within the Smart Cycle, including all necessary diagnostic testing and the latest technology (such as PGT-A, ICSI, etc.), and there are no mandatory requirements that discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals. Our Smart Cycle design also eliminates the discriminatory impact of dollar-cap designs.    Male factor fertility support     One-third of the time infertility is male factor, and Progyny’s comprehensive benefit supports every individual, no matter their gender. Progyny has curated a network of top reproductive urologists to support members who produce sperm. Progyny’s PCAs are trained to support those with male factor infertility, providing support and guidance on their fertility journey. Progyny also has a partnership with Legacy for at-home testing services, and our Smart Cycle comprehensively covers services for those with male factor infertility, such as prenatal labs, infectious disease testing, and preconception carrier screening.    Adoption and surrogacy support    Surrogacy and adoption support are an integrated part of Progyny’s offering. Members have unlimited access to dedicated PCA adoption and surrogacy coaches for comprehensive support, guidance, and education. The Smart Cycle benefit design also allows members pursuing surrogacy to use their benefit for pre-transfer embryology services, including egg retrieval (from a covered member), diagnostic testing, fertilization, embryo monitoring, and preimplantation genetic testing.     Integrated fertility medication program    Progyny provides integrated fertility medication coverage, Progyny Rx, for clients that utilize our fertility benefits solution. This solution provides our members with access to the medications needed during their treatment. Progyny Rx reduces dispensing and delivery time to two days to eliminate the risk of missed treatment cycles. We provide phone-based, clinical education and support seven days a week to ensure our members understand any necessary medication storage requirements and administration techniques, including injection training. Progyny Rx provides unit cost savings for our employer clients and an additional 10% savings from our waste management protocols.       Pregnancy, postpartum, menopause and primary care support (optional add-on programs)   Progyny offers extended support and care for members as they continue their journey through pregnancy, postpartum through midlife and menopause. Rather than members needing to start a new relationship with a different benefit provider, employers that opt-in to extended programs can enable members to continue their deep Progyny relationship for comprehensive navigation and access to expert care for their individualized health needs.   Progyny's pregnancy and postpartum care engages members across the pregnancy and postpartum journey, with coaching from pregnancy and postpartum experts, timely education and tracking, wraparound digital tools, and more – all with the goal of targeting high risk pregnancies, c-sections, and NICU admissions. Members receive unlimited access to maternity and postpartum experts and coaches who also support return to work, lactation, etc. Given the average age that members go through infertility treatment, many fertility members are considered high-risk pregnancies, so our pregnancy program enables clients to reach the most high-risk pregnancies on day one to reduce the likelihood of high-cost maternity claims, long patient recovery times, NICU visits, etc.    Progyny also offers Progyny+, a holistic primary care program where members with underlying health conditions that can make it hard to conceive or navigate a healthy pregnancy receive personalized primary care physician support, both virtually and in person. This program focuses on the member’s health from the PCP perspective, enabling them to manage and mitigate any underlying health conditions, be more likely to achieve a healthy pregnancy, and be supported through postpartum to enable a successful return to work.   Our menopause and midlife care connects members to leading network partners for virtual integrative care and hormonal and non-hormonal treatment. Members will have access to clinicians (OB/GYNs, MDs, and NPs) who are specialized in perimenopause, menopause, and midlife care for personalized treatment plans that help them manage their symptoms and take preventative steps.    Surrogacy and adoption reimbursement administration (optional add-on service)  Progyny can help clients configure a surrogacy and/or adoption reimbursement program or take over the administration of an existing program if desired.   Fertility preservation (optional add-on service)  Individuals may need to preserve their fertility for many reasons, including advanced age, injury, cancer treatment, transgender care, or other underlying diagnoses affecting fertility. Our clients can include elective and medically necessary fertility preservation coverage on a pre-tax or post-tax basis within their Smart Cycle plan design. Progyny standardly includes one year of tissue storage within each applicable Smart Cycle. Clients can choose to add additional years of tissue storage.   Donor tissue services (optional add-on service)  For members needing to purchase donor tissue (eggs or sperm), these services can be coordinated and covered under the Progyny benefit.     Doula reimbursement (optional add-on service)    Progyny offers a doula financial assistance program for which a member can be reimbursed for eligible expenses up to the established reimbursement limit. PCAs also provide support for members who are looking to find a doula for their pregnancy as well as postpartum doulas (from a vetted doula network/collaboratives). Studies have shown that families who have the continuous support of a doula have fewer medical interventions, shorter labors, lower caesarean rates, and overall, a more enjoyable birth experience.",1,"Progyny has an in-house legal staff with healthcare and regulatory expertise.

Color’s programs addresses these gaps. In our experience, the following elements have been essential for the development of our successful wellness program:  Color offers distributed screenings and full-touch support that gets participants to adhere to screening guidelines. Our program solves for convenient screening experience first - by offering no-cost, at-home screens for cardiometabolic disease, colorectal, cervical, and prostate cancer; by finding and scheduling appointments with in-network, available providers and screening centers on behalf of members; by providing a care team of clinicians and care advocates that are available outside of working hours, and more. By removing the barriers associated with accessing screenings and preventive care, we drive far higher adherence to screening recommendations than health plans.  Color provides the only comprehensive solution in the market that tackles cardiac disease and cancer costs from screening through diagnosis and care. By the time someone has a late-stage cancer diagnosis or advanced heart disease, it’s unfortunately often too late to impact outcomes and the total cost of treatment. That’s why our program focuses on screening and prevention. Beginning with a risk assessment which is a combination of family history, patient-reported outcomes, and environmental factors that drives eligibility parameters to determine the appropriate screening. Followed by a personalized care plan with appropriate screenings. We don’t stop there - as we know that it’s essential that those with an abnormal screen result get seen for prompt follow-up, and in the event of a diagnosis, we offer the support and resources needed to navigate their health.  Our accessible approach drives high participation and engagement. Through nearly 10 years of learned experience providing preventive care programs, we’ve developed an approach to access and engagement that drives results - seeing increased utilization with Color versus the other wellness programs. It starts with a simple, easy, and convenient participant-facing experience including, support in 200+ languages, clinician availability outside of working hours, and access to screening services at home or onsite. We tailor communications and enrollment messaging to resonate with participants, building trust from day one.   Our program is affordable, because our service delivery is highly efficient. When healthcare is delivered outside of the walls of hospitals and clinics, we’re able to drive down the costs that impact our customers and participants. As examples our tests for cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancer are designed to be self-administered. We offer efficient virtual clinical interactions via messaging, phone, and video, and we collapse the number of healthcare interactions needed by streamlining all referral, preauthorization, and follow-up needs into fewer events. Additionally, our team of highly experienced care advocates helps participants direct to in-person screening for breast and lung cancer screening, understand the costs of follow-on in-person care to avoid surprise bills and navigate to lower-cost/free options, when available. ",2,Our mandatory size minimum is 700 eligible members.,"We have two standard pricing models dependent on employer preference: platform-based  and utilization-based pricing. We work with firms like Sequoia to determine which approach might be most palatable to a client based on size and whether they are self or fully insured.     Platform-Based  Our PEPM (platform based) pricing is per eligible member, per month, and includes performance guarantees on utilization of the program.  This is best for a client seeking budget predictability and/or those with populations at high risk of cancer. The PEPM fee (between $1.45 - $5 depending on employer size) includes member health assessment, development of the member's care plan, support for getting them to complete their care plan, and high touch support to handle abnormal results follow-ups, plus a fee schedule for individual screening tests that Color can support directly, and that are billed based on utilization (e.g. at-home colorectal cancer screening using a FIT test, at-home PSA test for prostate cancer screening, at-home HPV test for cervical cancer screening, genetic testing for high risk individuals).  We define large market clients as those with a population of 20k+ eligible individuals. The PEPM rate for this population ranges from $1.45-$1.05 based on population size + $49 per at home screen (FIT, PSA, HPV) + $249 per genetic screen. We define mid-market clients as those with a population of 5k - 20k eligible individuals. The PEPM rate for this population is $1.75 + $49 per at home screen (FIT, PSA, HPV) + $249 per genetic screen. We consider how we define eligible individuals on a client by client basis. These eligibless could include either all full-time employees or all full-time employees and their dependents.   Utilization-Based  Our utilization based pricing is based on participant outcomes. This is best for a client seeking to bill claims through a health plan and is designed for a small budget investment relative to projected cost savings on cancer screening and care. This pricing model includes a simple fee schedule that is billed according to utilization of Color’s services by your employees/members — including up to four service bundles billed annually per participant. For self-insured clients, these pricing bundles can be billed directly through the plan as claims.  Annual member education & assessment: ACS-led participant education and content, including webinars, onsite education events when applicable, and in-app education for enrolled members about the importance of cancer screening and early cancer detection.  Cancer screening: for members who are determined by our clinical team to need a specific cancer screen, Color’s clinician will write an order for the appropriate test.  Genetic testing: for members determined by our clinical team to be eligible for genetic screening for hereditary cancer risk based on family and/or personal history, Color provides genetic testing, genetic counseling, and referrals to appropriate clinics and centers of excellence.  High risk & diagnosis management and support: for members determined by our clinical team to be at high risk of cancer based on family and/or personal history or who have an abnormal screening result or diagnosis that requires follow-up, Color provides more advanced clinical management.  Service Bundle - Color Fees - Billing Milestone  Annual member engagement & assessment - $50 - Billed annually based on participant enrollment and/OR ongoing engagement in program services  Cancer screening - $150 - Billed for each cancer screen completed by a participant, once screen result is made available to the participant  Genetic testing - $249 - Billed for each genetic test completed by a participant, once test result is made available to the participant  High risk & diagnosis management and support - $300 - Billed for each abnormal result or cancer diagnosis managed by Color per participant, once an abnormal result or diagnosis is made available to the participant or upon participant opting in to High Risk & Diagnosis Management and Support Services",,,,,1,1,1,,1,1,Care advocacy is available Monday through Friday from 8am-5pm in the patient’s local time zone.

Color's Care Advocates have extensive experience delivering patient-centered advocacy, education, and navigation, including strong knowledge of current research and guidelines for cancer screenings. They have deep knowledge and are experienced in navigating healthcare systems, insurance coverage, and community resources related to cancer care.  Additionally, Care Advocates are trained in delivering culturally competent care with Violet's Health Equity Platform. They are American Council on Exercise (ACE) Health Coach Certified to provide care navigation and health coaching. Although Care Advocates are not clinicians, they are critical to a patient's Care Team, ensuring participants complete their screenings and next steps. Care Advocacy can help patients with follow-up care in the following areas: - Assist participants with follow-up care with their established PCP and/or a specialist and help patients develop a PCP if they do not have one. - Coach participants to optimize their health and well-being through behavior-change science methods and lifestyle medicine principles. - Empower those struggling to realize their intentions by leveraging their unique skills, strengths, abilities, and untapped potential through behavior-change techniques. - Increase participants' understanding of insurance coverage and estimated costs.   Clinical Team - We provide clinically useful and actionable screening results - immediately linking participants to clinicians to discuss their results and next steps. We have a team of clinicians that are licensed and board certified in Internal Medicine and Family Medicine to provide care and prescribe medications in all 50 states. Our physicians are able to order screening, diagnostic imaging, and lab testing. We provide access to coaches, who support participants in their goals related to nutrition, weight loss, stress management, and more.  Genetic Counselors - Color’s Genetic Counselors are American Board of Genetic Counseling (ABGC) board-certified and licensed in U.S. states that require genetic counseling licensure. They provide unlimited education sessions to discuss cancer risk factors and screening recommendations.

Color has worked with thousands of organizations, including everything from large self-insured employers and labor unions, to federal agencies and state health departments. We have experience implementing our programs at scale with a strong record of reliability and timely delivery of services through on-time and on-budget implementations.  Our implementation approach is designed to allow flexibility for custom builds tailored towards the customer’s needs. Color’s implementation team will deliver a full project implementation plan within the first 7-10 days after the contract effective date with weekly updates provided in a format accessible by Sequoia’s client. This implementation plan will comprehensively detail all aspects of the screening, preventive care options, and care navigation support set up prior to the Go-Live date. Including the following: 1. Identification, timing, and assignment of significant responsibilities and tasks; 2. Identification and timing of deliverables and milestones; 3. Names and titles of key implementation staff; 4. Identification and timing of Sequoia’s client’s responsibilities; 5. Data requirements (indicate type and format of data required); 6. Identification and timing for the testing, acceptance and certification of exchange of data between Color and Sequoia’s client 7. Participant communications and their timing; 8. Schedule of in-person meetings and conference calls with the State; and 9. Transition requirements  Color has designed the implementation of the program to be easy for Sequoia’s client, and low overhead. We only need three things from Sequoia’s client to get started: 1) an eligibility file, 2) sharing the benefits guide so we can coordinate with relevant benefits and support direct referrals through our Care Advocates, 3) discuss and review our communication and employee onboarding plan to tailor it to the client's unique population and communication preferences. We ask the client's main POC to plan for only 3-4 45-min meetings ahead of launch that we will use to cover the three components we need and walk them through what to expect. Besides our main client contact, we'd ask that the client's technical POC responsible for eligibility file generation joins one of those meeting to discuss process for sharing and updating the client's eligibility file with Color. Following the launch, we typically set up bi-weekly or monthly check-ins with our main POC as appropriate to track program outcomes and metrics, and we also set up an Executive Business Review twice a year with the client's POC, their manager and executive leaders, that Color's executive leaders also attend.  All programs at Color include a robust implementation plan, a regular cadence to review program status and quickly resolve any issues that may arise. Once awarded, we will stand up a team of dedicated resources to support the program and its success for Sequoia’s client. This team will be responsible for all of the functions outlined and managing deliverables, and will be led by a Project Coordinator that will liaise between Color, Sequoia’s client, and any additional partners of the client. The individual we anticipate to assign is:   Steph Wolfram (Project Coordinator) will act as the main point of contact for the overall program, including ongoing meetings and status updates. Steph reports to Caroline Romanoff, Director of Client Services, and will also assume the role of Implementation Lead to oversee the launch, planning, execution, training, and onboarding of the program. We recommend having a standing meeting twice a week throughout implementation. Steph has over 11 years of experience launching and running programs across multiple industries. During her time at Color, she has worked on numerous healthcare offerings including launching three state-wide telehealth Covid-19 treatments programs, managing the logistics flow for a state-wide Covid-19 testing program responsible for resulting over 31,000 tests per week, and supporting over 3,700 vaccination clinics and providers.",F_29hWqTRzQKwSMOC,Sample Implementation Plan.pdf,22494,application/pdf,1,"Generally at least ninety (90) days, though depending on the specific program Color can work with partners on a contract by contract basis.","We know that getting employees to engage is paramount to the success of any preventive care program, so Color’s engagement approach is core to our program implementation. Through nearly 10 years of learned experience, we’ve developed a multi-faceted approach to engagement that drives results - seeing on average 4x higher utilization with Color versus average utilization in other wellness programs in the past for our preventive care programs.  We start by engaging individuals where they live and work to drive top-of-funnel awareness and engagement. We know that one size does not fit all, so our team works to tailor communications in a way that resonates for the employees, building trust from the get-go. For example: for field-laborer populations, we often work with the notion that spouses are the ones driving health decisions, so educating  them is part of our core engagement. We heavily focus on educational collateral (for example, pieces that help employees understand what genetic testing could tell them), to build curiosity and clearly communicate value in participation.  To continue to educate employees on opportunities and benefits of participation, we use digital and at-home mailers signed by trusted leadership, payroll stuffers, incentive programs, and even go onsite to health fairs or training centers to educate and support employees in person. Our engagement strategy continues throughout the year. For example, Color provides a monthly cancer awareness programming package - inclusive of flyers, webinars, email templates, and more to get the word out to your employees.   Another key to success is getting employees to take awareness a step further into action. Our care team, including clinicians, genetic counselors, and care advocates, work with each employee to help them understand their results, personalize screening guidelines, and help answer any questions so that they feel empowered by what they’ve learned to take control of their health.",F_2fCZm9GM8CNk78J,Sample Marketing Materials.pdf,24922179,application/pdf,"Color considers two primary verticals when thinking about increasing cultural diversity in the workforce; using a broad range of resources to attract talent and building an inclusive culture and hiring process. In the last few years, we have:  Talent Attraction: - Partnered with several external associations to increase and extend our reach: Epha, Out-of-Pocket, Techqueria, National Hispanic Medical Association, National Medical Association, and Circa. - Launched several Fellowship and Apprentice Programs focused on hiring non-traditional and underrepresented backgrounds: 3 Product Design Fellows, 2 Lab Operations Specialists through Emerson Collective, 2 Genetic Counselor Summer Scholars. - Launched an internal mobility process and guidelines to allow employees to continue developing their skills and careers and transfer to a different role and team. - Increased our passive outreach to female candidates by 16% (41 to 57%)  Inclusive Process: - Launched company-wide interviewer training. Trained over 400 employees on subjects including unconscious bias and how to write constructive feedback. - Launched company-wide hiring manager training. Trained over 30 hiring managers on subjects including unconscious bias and making inclusive decisions. - Established and launched an accommodation process, email, and phone number for candidates. - Added and included EEO tagline on all of our job posts.

Employee Resource Groups are a key way to strengthen our culture, support employees, and foster increased engagement which includes an increasing number of remote and hybrid employees. ERGs are an extension of the Color DEI team, providing valuable feedback, unique perspectives, and insights that benefit both internal employees and external customers.   DEI Projects and initiatives in partnership with ERGs this year include: - Mentoring program  - Speaker series focused on professional development  - Identify and resolve accessibility issues for disabled employees - Recruitment of key talent from underrepresented groups - Company-wide DEI programming to increase cultural competency - Company-sponsored tech grant for women and gender diverse employees - Support and tools for working parents - Mental health awareness  Career growth fellowship-style programs being maintained or run by various Color teams in the coming year:  - Color GC Programs (GC Summer Scholars and GC Immersive) - Emerson Collective FirstGen Internship Program - NGS Lab CGMBS Training Program",1,,"Color has a flexible eligibility process to ensure we meet the needs of each unique organization and to ensure an easy sign up process for eligible participants. From the organization, we will need to know who is eligible (employees and/or partners and/or dependents 18+; all employees or just health plan participants, etc.) and key verifiable information about those participants to allow them to sign up and access the benefit.   Currently we most often see two types of eligibility factors: - Demographic identifier (First Name, Last Name, DOB, Zip Code) OR - Other identifiers (i.e. email, employee ID, etc.)  During implementation, Color's eligibility experts will work with you and your data teams to identify the most inclusive and simplest way to pull eligibility. Color is happy to provide a data specification document so that your team can simply pull the required fields from your internal systems, or we can work with your team to pull the data and reformat on our end.   Collecting network coverage depends on the eligible population.  If all eligible participants are part of the same overall plan, we would collect that core information upfront and build it into our benefits routing and in-network/out of network considerations to ensure continuity of care.  If you have several populations with varying coverage options, we would work with your team to best identify a way to collect that information on an individual basis. We would also collect other benefit information during implementation to ensure that we are routing your employees to other relevant benefits (providing warm hand offs to those benefits as appropriate).

Because Grayce Care Partners are master’s-level professionals, we use training to provide a broad context and understanding of issues in order to enhance their advanced skills: •Onboarding for new hires–orientation to the company, role policies and procedures, data security, privacy and HIPAA compliance. •Concierge Model–As part of the onboarding process, there is a specific module on our high-touch approach to helping caregivers, including how to match parents and caregivers and make appropriate recommendations. •Quarterly Meetings–Understand trends and events that affect families, especially world events that touch employees and family members internationally •Annual Forums focused on cultural competencies and DEI Care Partners are licensed, so we support their pursuit of continuing education units to maintain licensure.   •Social Determinants of Health  Master's-level Care Partners have the training, skills and experience to identify any social determinants of health (SDOH) issue—housing, food, transportation, utilities, and personal safety. It is a natural part of what we do when we conduct consultations with caregivers. Care Partners know how to make the caregiver feel comfortable and are quick to establish a relationship of trust. They address the immediate request but also listen carefully for related or underlying issues. They are always looking at the caregiver, the loved one and the entire family holistically, and they can identify SDOH and solve issues when they are present within the caregiver’s family or with a loved one living alone. They connect with community agencies and social services to set up assistance for the loved one (and family), such as Meals on Wheels, transportation to doctor’s appointments, subsidized housing, medical care and medications, mental health services and more.

We use clinically validated machine learning, what we call Precision Mental Healthcare, to deliver optimal care — digital CBT, coaching, therapy, medication management, or a combination of all four. We are on a mission to eliminate every barrier to mental health. Our member-centric approach and experience has led to rapid adoption among large employers and year-over-year growth of 270%. We believe the following differentiators demonstrate our passion for caring the most about mental healthcare.  - Our clinically validated technology, Precision Mental Healthcare, accurately predicts the right treatment that will work for each member’s mental health care journey. The technology eliminates ineffective treatment, speeds up recovery time by 8 weeks, and helps over 86% of members fully recover. Important to note, that our technology is clinically validated and peer-reviewed by trusted medical publications, including JAMA, The Lancet, American Psychiatric Association (APA).  - A sophisticated Care Support program strives to provide a transformative member and provider experience through timely resolution, empathy, and professionalism. The team’s primary responsibilities include responding to real-time member and clinician inquiries and needs such as (but not limited to) scheduling, triaging prescription refill requests, executing patient documentation and resource items, and troubleshooting platform access issues. Also, whenever needed, each member has access to a Care Navigator, licensed therapists schooled, trained, and experienced working with members of all conditions on the mental health spectrum, from lightweight mild issues (work-life and resiliency) to extremely clinical and severe (substance use and suicidal ideation). Finally, this coordinated and collaborative approach is reflected in our comprehensive platform, Compass, an EHR developed with and for our providers.  - We curate our provider network with a priority on diversity, availability, and evidence and measurement-based treatment. Our network comprises many ethnic and racial backgrounds and specialties to create an inclusive environment to seek care. Our network is 3x the national average for providers who identify as BIPOC, 6x the national average for providers who identify as Black, and 2x the national average for providers who identify as Asian. We ensure providers are available during traditional and non-traditional hours (before/after work and on weekends) and the average time to first appointment is <2 days. We align with providers who are committed to evidence-based treatment and continuous measurement.  - Our proprietary technology, Candela, measures provider performance, in real-time, to ensure the highest quality network and care for members. Higher-quality care means a shorter time to recover, drastically lowering healthcare costs. We track care across clinical metrics, such as depression and anxiety improvement, and operational metrics, such as time commitment to Spring Health’s customers and member experience. We align higher, data-proven, quality to payment as financial incentives for higher-performing providers and see our solution as the first pay-for-performance network in mental health care.  - We have developed an electronic health record, integrated by all our providers, called Compass. The Compass platform supports delivering the most clinically and financially effective mental healthcare. Providers receive data that shows and predicts member progress toward an outcome. This allows the provider to give more accurate diagnoses, modify treatment plans in real time, and improve patient outcomes faster. The tools available through Compass make it easier for therapists to use outcome measures, reduce administrative burden and burnout, and enable effective collaboration by providing a well-designed EHR workflow. This coordinated and collaborative approach supports the entire Spring Health Care Team — from clinicians to support staff — to deliver smarter and faster mental healthcare. Coaches will be fully incorporated into Compass in Q1 2024.  - Spring Health delivers financial ROI in several ways. The Validation Institute recently certified Spring Health as the first and only comprehensive mental health solution to show net savings for customers, lowering total health plan spend by $2,430 per participant in the first six months of engagement. Access to high-quality mental health providers more than paid for itself; for every $1.00 invested in Spring Health, customers saved $2.20 on their health plan spend. Those savings increased to $4.10 when accounting for reduced absenteeism (22%) and turnover (12%).  - Spring Health delivers the most accurate and transparent pricing in the market, which functions to secure a client’s investment with its comprehensive mental health partner. We are committed to cost transparency in several unique ways, including a standardized national rate card. No matter where employees are located or what type of provider they see, the rate remains the same. Furthermore, with zero hidden fees, our clients are never surprised by unexpected costs (technology, intersession fees, etc.), which often get tacked onto our competitors’ invoices. We have also recently refined our ROI methodology to create more accurate pricing and ROI projections by incorporating data-backed assumptions and organizational-specific metrics.",2,No,"Our pricing structure is flexible.

In addition, Spring Health communicates directly to employees through email, home mailers, and more at launch and throughout the year. We also provide HR and manager training to equip managers with the knowledge and information to recognize mental health needs and refer employees to the right resources.  We have deployed strategies that engage a diverse workforce, from front-line workers to knowledge workers, including:  Executive leadership email — Communications from leaders promoting and emphasizing the Spring Health benefit. We have found that executive endorsement helps motivate employees and can be served in many meaningful mediums (e.g., town halls, video messages, memos, print materials, etc.). Leveraging managers/HR managers — For many employees, their main source of information is their manager, so arming managers with information and talking points is key to a successful rollout. Our team will lead training sessions focused on getting managers familiar with the Spring Health benefit and how to refer employees. We also provide managers with talking points, handouts, and exercises to use at group meetings. Leveraging wellness champions or resource groups — Promoting the benefit through these channels helps others tell the story of Spring Health. We provide employee resource groups with materials relevant to their community and/or purpose to help ensure these employees are aware of key attributes of Spring Health — such as our diverse provider network — that will encourage engagement among their population. Home mailers and electronic/print materials — Home mailers help engage not only the employee but family members as well and are especially relevant for people who do not access a computer during work. Flyers, posters, electronic signage, and wallet cards that have a QR code directing members to the Spring Health portal make it easy for members to enroll quickly and seamlessly. Additional partnership and communication around open enrollment have proven to be impactful. Spring Health Benefit Overview — These employee webinar sessions provide a detailed overview of Spring Health benefits, from either an employee or manager perspective, and can be recorded and shared internally for future use. Email campaigns — Activation emails directing employees to the Spring Health portal are an effective way to help people take action when they are ready. Year-round webinars and small group therapy sessions — Employees have year-round access to support employees throughout the year with Community WellSprings, our optional small group sessions, and monthly events and resources on topics such as grief, friendship, substance use, and more. On-site visits — Booths at key locations for hard-to-reach employee populations and/or attendance at in-person benefit fairs and Open Enrollment are also helpful.

Clinical-grade care is always provided by a Doctor of Physical Therapy As a fundamental business imperative, Sword matches every member with one of our Doctors of Physical Therapy (DPTs) to guide them through every step of their therapeutic journey. This is the safest and best option because only a DPT has the knowledge and experience needed to diagnose members at enrollment, monitor their performance ongoing, and resolve their sources of pain in the long-term.   2. Real-time feedback for all joints and conditions Sword’s FDA-listed device (our Digital Therapist) is required to meet a level of clinical and technological reliability, precision, and efficiency that non FDA-listed tech are not. Sword uses both sensors and computer vision to capture movement with high precision, taking 25 measurements per second, and providing up to 5,000 different types of feedback, teaching the member precisely how to perform their exercises while sending a wealth of clinical data to the member's Sword DPT.  3. Every member receives a tailored therapeutic program Each care program is designed around the unique member’s specific MSK condition, their movement requirements both at work and in their personal lives, and their individual goals. No two members, regardless of their affected area or therapeutic history, receive the same treatment program. We understand that each individual’s goals and challenges are unique, so their care program should be as well.  4. More clinical research than the entire industry combined Sword is widely regarded as the most clinically rigorous digital physical therapy program on the market, and we commit to continue pushing the industry in this direction. Sword has published more peer-reviewed research in scientific journals than any other digital MSK vendor in the industry, and as a company, we hold more than 30 patents, which is 3x more than the nearest competitor in the industry.  5. Validated savings and clinical outcomes Sword is the only digital MSK solution that has achieved independent certification by the Validation Institute for both Level 1, clinical third-party validation of our data and clinical outcomes as well as Level 2, cost savings. Through a two-year claims-based study, they found that Sword reduces average MSK costs by $2,472 per enrolled participant compared to a matched control group. ",2,"Yes - 1,000","Sword’s Fee Structure Sword believes in a pay-per-performance or utilization-based pricing model. The maximum total cost a client would spend for any given member is capped at $1,000 per participant per year. To protect our clients from financial risk, Sword's pricing model is dependent on member utilization. Unlike some digital physical therapy solutions that invoice 100% or the majority of their fees when a member enrolls in their program, Sword does not bill the full annual per participant fee upfront. Instead, we will bill the customer in three separate stages that are tied participant utilization as outlined below:  Total Proposed Cost: $1,000 per participant per year  •  Milestone 1 - Enrolled: 50% of fees are due when the member completes their onboarding assessment, completes an eligibility questionnaire, or has completed their first Exercise Visit on the Platform (whichever comes first).  •  Milestone 2 - Engaged: 25% of fees are due when the member successfully completes the first 3 sessions of their program.  •  Milestone 3 - Committed: 25% of fees are due when the member successfully completes 9 sessions of their program.  Please note that members can use Sword’s program as often as they like for the entire year at no additional cost.",F_vcoeGha3m00MD1D,Sequoia Benefits Pricing Sheet_2023.pdf,2235107,application/pdf,1,1,,1,,1,"We offer customer service support 24 hours per day on weekdays and 8:00a.m. to 8:00p.m. ET on the weekends.  Our DPTs are often the first level of support since they have an existing relationship with the participant and can often troubleshoot or pull in the right Sword resource to resolve issues quickly. Of note, our DPTs are available from 8:00a.m. to 10:00p.m. ET for onboarding calls. For follow-up appointments, DPTs work to accommodate members’ desired hours.","Sword has developed a customer support model in which each member is assigned a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) as their single point of contact throughout their journey to ensure each member’s progress and performance is monitored and supported. Sword has intentionally chosen not to use health coaches for this important role as our experience has shown that using a DPT is the most effective and popular model from the member's perspective.  Our DPTs provide their cell phone numbers to members so the member can call, text, or access them through chat at any time using the Sword Mobile App. If the DPT is unable to resolve an issue, it is escalated to an appropriate Sword team member to reach a satisfactory conclusion and ensure the member is appropriately cared for. If a member has a question about the program itself before they are enrolled and assigned a DPT, they also have the option to reach out to the concierge Sword asset who is assigned to the client. In all cases, we are committed to supporting our clients and their members at all times and in all stages during the process.","Sword exclusively hires Doctors of Physical Therapy (DPT) to provide individual care for our members. We require each of our DPTs to be graduates of a CAPTE-accredited program, pass a national licensure exam (NPTE), and obtain state licensure(s) where they will be practicing. We also seek out DPTs with a minimum of three years of work experience (though most have far more) to ensure our members are receiving the most knowledgeable and appropriate direction for their condition.  At Sword, each member’s treatment is provided by their Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) who is individually selected by the unique member at intake, ensuring they work with a person who resonates with them. From the moment the DPT creates the member’s first exercise session through the completion of the program, the member is fully supported by this same individual. Sword exclusively hires licensed physical therapists, all of whom have a Doctorate of Physical Therapy (DPT) degree and at least three years of post-graduate clinical experience (though most have far more), to provide individualized care for our members. We hire all of our clinical staff based on these stringent requirements because the advanced skill set and education associated with the credentials makes physical therapists the expert of choice for providing MSK and pelvic health care. We also hire with a preference for demonstrated experience in using behavioral change skills such as motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy tools, all with the goal of reflecting the diversity of our members.",,1,1,,,1,1,1,72,,"We can launch our solution in as little as 6-8 weeks. Successful implementations is another Sword asset and our clients in a post implementation survey, have graded us with an average implementation score of 9.7 out of 10. Once the process begins, Sword will assign an Implementation Manager and dedicated Customer Success Manager to oversee the implementation as well as the ongoing partnership. Client resources will need to be available for a one-time 60-minute implementation kickoff meeting followed by bi-weekly 30-minute working sessions until the launch date is reached (typically 4-8 meetings). Sword's team will track and drive all work streams in an implementation project plan, all of which will be shared with the Client to ensure visibility of project milestones. These workstreams include any activities and tasks related to integrating with other suppliers in the ecosystem (i.e., TPA, eligibility vendor, health plan, etc), which may require an email or phone introduction to suppliers in other ecosystems to help establish and facilitate a working relationship. Please note that we work closely with each of our new clients to get a fair gauge for the required hours needed from their side so they can best prepare the appropriate personnel and workload.  Once the Client has decided to implement Sword, they will be assigned a dedicated Customer Success Manager (CSM) who is available to provide support from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. by phone and email. The CSM will work with the Client to understand your objectives and the needs of your population, as well as oversee the launch of the Sword solution. Our CSMs build and iterate the marketing strategy to engage the population, develop and support the content strategy, and train teams and third parties within the Client’s ecosystem. Additionally, the CSM will also share ongoing performance reports and lead regular business review meetings to assess Sword’s impact on the Client population.  Additionally, the member experience with Sword and Bloom (pelvic floor therapy) are at the top of our priority list. Our Doctors of Physical Therapy (DPTs) have multiple touch points with each member each week (2-4x/week). Each member is able to choose the DPT they want to work with and that person will stay with them throughout their plan of care. This allows members to develop trusting relationships with members, which creates a better user experience and better outcomes. The typical member journey is as follows:  •  Potential members are identified and reached through marketing campaigns (emails, home mailers, social, SMS, digital ads, webinars, advertisements, print, etc.). •  Members can access Sword through Sydney/Live Health Online as a front door. •  Members complete an enrollment form, are checked for eligibility, and each member is able to read a short bio on our DPTs to select who they would like to work with throughout their plan of care. Once the member makes a selection, they will remain with the same DPT. This drives better relationships, engagement, and ultimately better outcomes. •  Members will receive their Digital Therapist kit (motion sensors and tablet) via mail and are asked to schedule a 1:1 video consultation with their Sword DPT. •  Members complete the video consultation where they meet their DPT, discuss their goals, cover their medical history, familiarize themselves with the program, and are screened for red flags. •  Upon receiving their Digital Therapist kit, members are guided step-by-step through the process of general maintenance (wearing their sensors, charging the kit) and encouraged to begin. We make the Digital Therapist® kit easy to use, ensuring members are able to begin their exercises daily with minimal navigation. •  Members progress through an 8-12 week program (on average) with exercises 3-5x/weekly (as customized by the DPT). Throughout the plan of care, the DPT will review and adjust the program as necessary, share educational tools, and correspond with the member. •  Our DPTs reach out to members between 3-4x per week through the ideal communication channels established during onboarding (e.g. chat, email, or phone). Every 4 weeks the member meets with their DPT via video call to reassess progress and goals. This process continues until the member is pain free or goals have been attained.   •  At the end of each member’s program, members are free to transition to a maintenance phase, which is an additional exercise program with the Digital Therapist or return the kit using the prepaid shipping label and materials.  The Bloom process has a similar journey.  The main difference is that each member will work 1:1 with a Doctor of Physical Therapy who specializes in women’s health, specifically pelvic floor therapy.

From the top down, we have built a world-class physical care company based on these principles. We believe a more diverse and inclusive workforce is essential to delivering the best care, service, and outcomes for our members. We also recognize that many members face deep-rooted disparities that prevent them from receiving equal care, and we have an important responsibility to break down these systemic barriers as much as possible.  Sword’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) is visible throughout our organization. It can be seen in our leadership, in the people we hire, in the way we treat members, and in the way we see strength in our differences. For us, DE&I isn’t just a corporate buzzword. It’s the key to our productivity, innovation, and industry-leading success. Here’s how we drive DE&I at all levels of our company:  Who Leads at the Top Our senior leadership team consists of executives from diverse ethnic backgrounds, and a third of our leaders are women. Our Portuguese-born founder and CEO, Virgílio Bento, has long been a champion of diversity and inclusion. His genuine commitment ensures that these initiatives get the support that they need and deserve, from the CEO’s office on down.  How We Train All of our physical therapists are required to undergo training on gender-affirmative and LGBTQ+ cultural competency and education. We follow curricula developed by the creators of the PT Proud movement, whose objective is to address health disparities and improve the healthcare experience of LGBTQ+ patients and clinicians. We also provide other training to build equitable values and create a sensitive environment for all members.  How We Maximize Outcomes At Sword, one of our core tenets is that everyone’s pain is different. We recognize that each member comes to us with a unique set of goals, challenges, and circumstances. Their recovery should be as personal as their story. That’s why the Sword program is designed to deliver tailored care at every step, combining industry-leading motion-capture technology with 100% of care from Doctors of Physical Therapy. Truly personalized treatment is the key to maximizing adherence and improving outcomes for our members. It is also important to note that the Sword solution is available in English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese, with staffed DPTs who can speak these languages.  Who We Hire Sword’s mission is to free 2 billion people from pain—regardless of their race or background, and we believe it is critically important that our workforce reflect the diversity of the members we serve. We want our members to see themselves in Sword, and we want our employees to deeply understand the challenges that our members face. In this spirit, we have one of the highest percentages of female employees among companies in the digital healthcare space. Additionally, nearly a quarter of our licensed physical therapists, who personalize the treatment for each and every member, come from underrepresented minority groups. About 11% of our physical therapists are bilingual or multilingual. While we aim to hire the best talent, we also hire with the goal of creating a diverse workforce so everyone feels represented.  Sword Equity Council We have also created an internal equity council, which is open to all Sword employees and led by them. The council not only serves as an internal guiding light on all DE&I issues within the company, but also allows each collaborator to make meaningful contributions to DE&I initiatives. The council has a direct line to our leadership team to make recommendations to further our commitment to diversity and inclusion.  Our APTA Partnership In its first ever collaboration with a digital musculoskeletal company, the American Physical Therapy Association partnered with Sword Health to support DE&I efforts within the profession. Powered by an annual funding commitment of $100,000 from Sword, this initiative aims to drive new models of care and increase health access for underserved communities. This effort will also fund scholarships for underrepresented minorities seeking to pursue.",1,,"Sword will request demographic data for the sake of confirming eligible members as they apply for the Sword treatment, to identify members living with an MSK condition for the purposes of targeted outreach, and to ensure Sword is able to communicate the impact of the program to your population.

If another transfer method is preferred, we are happy to make accommodations. We typically request a monthly eligibility file in order to effectively make Sword Health available to your members.

All the components of our program are delivered through the Sword Member App, or, if preferred by the member, they can be delivered via email (web-based). Also accessible via the Sword Member App, Sword provides a variety of educational tools and resources.    Digital Physical Therapy Every Sword member is paired with a dedicated Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) and our Digital Therapist, which leverages our FDA-listed tablet, computer vision, and inertial motions sensors to offer real-time biofeedback to both the member and their DPT. We have programs addressing acute, chronic, and post-surgical MSK pain, and are the only digital physical therapy solution with peer-reviewed outcomes on all three scenarios.    Women’s Health Program, Pelvic Floor Therapy Bloom is Sword’s women’s health program that consists of a sensor-based and data-driven, tailored solution designed to address the whole spectrum of pelvic and reproductive issues including childbirth (prepartum, pregnancy, postpartum), pelvic health, urinary/bowel health, and menopause. Bloom is the only women’s product in the industry that offers an intravaginal device that measures contraction, force, and elongation of the pelvic floor, and provides real-time feedback, monitors progress, and shares outcomes so their plan can be tailored.

Tilt was founded in 2017. Our founder, Jen Henderson, was inspired to build Tilt after her own parental leave experiences - which happened twice.   From Jen’s words, “I spent 15 years as a leader in corporate America. I saw talented, driven employees hit serious slowdowns in their careers when they started a family. Again and again, we lost some of our best employees around the time of their parental leave.   Those employees would not have walked away if we had created a smooth leave process and supportive environment.  As a professional mom with 2 small children, I experienced career stagnation myself. My employers assumed I didn’t want to put in 110% anymore. I was left out of critical conversations and skipped over for ambitious projects.  As we’ve worked with employers, we find that miscommunication, reactive behavior, biases, and assumptions are at the root of 99% of the issues. All of which can be prevented. That’s why we built Tilt. Parents deserve to feel comfortable and confident returning to work after leave. And companies shouldn’t lose top talent because their employees decide to start a family.""  One of our company virtues is “Love our Customers.” Not only do we have a dedicated Customer Success Manager assigned to each of our customers HR teams, we also understand taking a leave of absence is a very personal and emotional life event. Which is why Tilt has dedicated 1:1 support for employees along the whole journey. We not only love our customers, but we serve all people with a humble head and human heart.  ","Implementation Guide: Tilt assigns this role based on the time of contract completed and specific needs to a company. The implementation team has an average of 3-5 years of experience. Typically the implementation guide is onboarding around 4 companies at any given time.   Customer Success Manager: The Customer Success Manager is the dedicated 1:1 contact for the HR team. Our Customer Success Managers average around 5-7 years of experience. The Customer Success Manager typically supports around 20-30 companies total.  Leave Success Manager: The Leave Success Manager is the dedicated 1:1 contact for the employee and manager. Our Leave Success Managers average of 5 years of experience in leave of absence or a related industry. Our Leave Success Managers are assigned accounts based on the number of leaves rather than the number of accounts, so it can range from 1 dedicated account to 12, depending on leave volume.   In-house Compliance Team: This team is comprised of a Labor & Employment attorneys, FMLA experts, ADA specialists and payroll specialists. Collectively they average 30+ years of experience. This team ensures the way to manage leave of absence on our customers behalf is always compliant with Federal and State regulations.

Our implementation process is 5-7 weeks or 7-10 weeks depending on size of company and consists of the following steps:  Complete an onboarding form that will outline information about the company benefits. This is also when we explain the steps of setting up the SFTP file feeds.  First call (Discovery call) to review company information as well as outline the process for the coming weeks.  Tilt will begin to create the custom Tilt platform. This will include company benefit information (e.g. leave policies) so HR is able to see exactly how a leave plan will look in our platform.  Platform training session - on this call, we will show HR how to navigate Tilt as an HR user. We will go over details such as initiating leaves, reviewing leave requests, and reviewing leave plans.  Payroll education session - on this call, we will review the payroll reports that Tilt will be providing the team. Tilt asks for edits to the platform (or plans). We provide 7 calendar days for these edits to be turned back into us.  Edits are made by Tilt.  If necessary, we will meet again to review the edits made and/or revisit the Tilt platform, HR functionality, and how to find and view leave plans.  Final call (the launch call). The Success team (Customer Success Manager + Leave Success Managers) join on this call and make themselves available for any questions.  The customer will enter the onboarding phase, which begins after go-live. Their Tilt Success Team (CSM, LSM, and IG) will be available to answer questions as they start using the platform and initiating leaves and will be a resource as the team uses Tilt payroll report for the first time.

The average time to the first offered therapy appointment is two business days. Our average wait time for the first psychiatry appointment is 8 business days.

These people, society and policy initiatives are grounded by an Inclusive Impact Model & Theory of Change, to systematize DEIB work done across teams and align them with our Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Key areas of focus include: -Fostering a culture of DEIB among leaders and within cross-functional teams to enhance the employee experience, strengthen governance and a values-based culture. -Conducting place-based outreach, engagement, activation to drive member growth in areas of heightened social vulnerability where historically underserved individuals live, work, play, pray, and get educated. -Growing policy and mental health sector thought leadership across three policy priorities: mental health prevention for all, advancing mental health equity, expanding and protecting telehealth  We recognize that creating a world where everyone is kind to their mind requires addressing inequitable conditions in the places where individuals live, work, play, pray, and get educated. Our goals are to foster a climate and culture of mindfulness and mental health  that promotes transformative action inside our organization, for our members, and in the world.  Refer to the following for a few examples of our recent initiatives: -We have hired a c-suite leader for DEIB that reports directly to the CEO (Our diversity and social impact initiatives and teams are led by Dr. Wizdom Powell, Chief Social Impact and Diversity Officer: https://www.linkedin.com/in/wizdomp) -We have invested in our ERGs by providing them programming budgets and a stipend for our ERG leaders.  -We have hosted fish bowls with youth in the UK to better understand the unique experience of youth from historically excluded communities. -We expanded the DEIB team to hire a dedicated individual who supports our ERGs and cultural heritage month programming. -We have invested in external partnerships with organizations that help us connect with talent from historically excluded groups. -We expanded our DEIB data collection to better understand the diversity that exists across the company.    -We created DEIB data dashboards to help use data to guide the company’s workforce diversity efforts. -We created organization-wide principles for inclusive product and content design to ensure that we layer in a DEIB lens at the inception of, as well as, throughout the development process.  Within our virtual, on-demand mental health system, making mental healthcare accessible to all has been and will continue to be a key priority - both for our internal organization and for the clients and members we serve. Here are a few examples of ways we approach it:  Representative Care:  -Given underrepresentation in providers is a barrier to equitable mental healthcare, we actively address this inequity through the representation in our internal care team of coaches, therapists, and psychiatrists.   Representative Content:  -Our onboarding experience includes demographic data collection to enable a more personalized care experience. -We recently acquired Shine, a mental health and wellness app dedicated to providing an inclusive mental health experience for the BIPOC community.  -In addition to our acquisition of Shine, we added new teachers and special content collections to support a diverse workforce.  -Our self-care collections are led by certified meditation teachers and experts in nutrition, resilience, youth empowerment, neuroscience, emotion science, and stress management. Headspace’s diverse range of teachers, voices, and partnerships are designed to provide an inclusive experience for members and facilitate conversations around important topics like Black joy, racial injustice, and Asian mental health. Additionally, by partnering with Dive in Well, Headspace offers a collection of resources and meditations that cover topics like social justice, grief, anger, love, and community.   The discovery of need around SDoH is also a focal point in our approach to working with members. Discovery of SDoH needs does not often follow a clear path as many members will feel embarrassed or even ashamed that they are struggling with housing, access to food or dependable transportation. Our clinicians who support members via telephone, and our coaches, who are texting with members, are trained to explore these sensitive issues and initiate meaningful connections to community based organizations, or other resources within your benefit offering, that address these most important needs.   We also maintain a diverse board of directors, executive team, and broader employee population. For example, approximately 52% of our employees are from ""Historically Excluded Groups"" (non-white, not hetero, or disabled) and 44% of our employees affirmatively identify as non-white.

As COBRA requires that group health plans offer employees and their families the opportunity to receive continuation coverage in certain circumstances where coverage under the plan would otherwise end, the key question is whether the Headspace services a client  provides its employees constitute medical care. If the Headspace services provide medical care, it is likely that the services are COBRA eligible.

A familiar voice establishes trust and credibility for the Omada Program in advance of the deployment and should be the first communication sent in a campaign series. We will provide a template that a client management team member can cut and paste into their email program  2) Multi-touch email series sent by Omada spanning six emails per campaign, with an annual calendar launching between 4-5 campaigns (or to the clients' discretion). When it comes to enrolling members into Omada, we’ve learned that email is 3x-10x more effective than direct mail or onsite events. To further increase the effectiveness of email, Omada has invested in consumer research to develop a proven email narrative that speaks to the benefits, features, and motivations that resonate with potential Omada members.

Our LSA offering is just one of the many programs we can administer (Wellness, Food & Grocery, Healthcare Travel, Pre-Tax Accounts, Education and Tuition Support, and more).    Our Differentiators:  1) A financial technology foundation that empowers employees with access to pre-funded accounts. These accounts represent the employer's benefit programs and can be accessed simply by charging their Benepass Visa Card at a merchant (physically or virtually) or submitting an expense for reimbursement, which we adjudicate and pay out (via ACH in the US) for our clients. Access to a funded account removes the need for employees to front the cost for their benefits programs, which has enabled our clients to see over 85% employee engagement. Our card-based approach enables employers to deploy global benefits that are equitable across domestic and international employees.  2) An administration and policy layer gives account administrators control over how they customize, adapt, and monitor these programs. This enables employers to customize their benefits to match the company's vision and values while providing the agility and flexibility to adapt to employee needs. During a client's relationship with Benepass, they will partner with our Implementation Experts / a Dedicated Customer Success Manager to design their programs. Our CSMs will be available on an ongoing basis to help strategize on topics like new program iterations and tactics to increase engagement and to provide benchmarks and learnings from other companies in the Benepass ecosystem.  3) Enterprise-level capabilities with automation, reporting, controls, integrations & employee well-being data make administering modern benefits, like an LSA, painless for clients. We integrate directly with HRIS and Payroll systems to make it seamless to sync rosters, enroll or term employees, and manage tax compliance at scale. And we provide out-of-the-box reporting like transaction history, reconciliation reporting, and imputed income to ensure any business stakeholder can quickly get the data they need. Employee wellbeing data is live and used to consistently see how your employees are engaging with their benefits programs, to make programs better, and more meaningful to employees over time. We have bi-directional syncs with payroll systems like Workday.  4) Equitable Global benefits experience & parity: Localize Benepass app for each country with translated currency to ensure every global employee has a seamless experience in their local region/country. Benepass' global reach means employees can spend wherever Visa is accepted! Benebot, our generative AI tool, can also handle receipts in different languages and answer employee questions in any language.   5) A consumer-grade experience for employees: Member Experience is at the forefront of how Benepass was built. We pride ourselves on a modern user experience for employees. A member's first experience with Benepass is the mobile app and web portal to set up their account, view stipend balances, explore the marketplace, and instantly access their virtual VISA card, all via a self-service model. Our platform and program work the way an individual lives and works. We believe """"one size fits all"""" benefit models do not provide an equitable experience for employees globally, so we are enabling our clients to give their most prized asset, their people, the power to choose how their benefits need to work for them.

By offering the full spectrum of reproductive health, wellness, and fertility care under one solution, Kindbody ends the fragmentation of care which directly improves outcomes and reduces the number of point solutions involved in a patient's journey.  Innovation, technology, multi-modal approach to care: Kindbody uniquely combines virtual telemedicine care, in-person care, digital -patient portal, experienced navigation, and ability to integrate within an employer’s ecosystem to provide a seamless member experience that ends fragmentation of care and supports members throughout their reproductive health continuum.  As clinical experts we guarantee that our end-to-end multi-modal approach to care translates to a better member experience, improved outcomes, and cost savings.   Guaranteed Savings: Kindbody replaces legacy fee-for-service solutions with value-based case rates and transparent pricing, in turn avoiding excessive provider reimbursements and vendor margins. Our value-based bundled case rates include all services required to complete a fertility cycle.  This includes PGT-A (preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy), which is critical for enhancing outcomes. Unlike other benefits managers, Kindbody only charges for this testing when it’s used, avoiding unnecessary costs for employers and members.  For fertility medications, KindbodyRx enhances the family-building benefit and increases value. KindbodyRx’s virtual pharmacy combines significant fertility medication savings with 24/7 personalized support. It is the only solution able to provide pharmacy cost guarantees on a bundled, per-treatment-cycle basis, rather than a cost-per-script pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) model. These financial models align incentives to treat the patient holistically in their fertility journey, providing the best care while managing waste and overspending. Kindbody estimates that, on average, employers will save 25% annually in direct medical and pharmacy costs by partnering with Kindbody, compared to other solutions. ",2,"Kindbody targets all domestic markets with a minimum of 1,000 eligible employees and multinational employers with global members. We will evaluate global minimums on a case by case basis, given an employer meets our U.S. minimum; No annual minimums  In addition, employers of any size can take advantage of the Small Business Model Kindbody deployed in 2023 through established partnerships with: Justworks, Namely, Bennie, BenefitBump, New Benefits, Rightway and more. In these relationships, Kindbody’s partner owns the contract and their own pricing arrangements.  Consultants or employers can reach out directly to each entity for costing and contract options. ","Kindbody’s solution centers on transparency. Our pricing model is different than any other in this space with a one time implementation fee and utilization based pricing. We provide value-based bundled case rates with care navigation fee per utilizing member included in the case rate with no mark ups or hidden fees. These case rates are consistent across all U.S. markets, allowing employers to provide a rich, equitable benefit regardless of member location.   To determine utilization, Kindbody will leverage our book of business or can evaluate employer's historical data to determine utilization and cost projections.

The implementation manager will host a key stakeholders kick-off meeting with every department represented and project status calls (weekly or biweekly cadence as mutually agreed to with the client).   Internal/external stakeholders who will be part of the overall project includes, but not limited to, Operations, Account Management, Customer Success/CX, Sales/Partnerships, Finance, Marketing, Product, IT along with any other Vendor Partners.   The implementation manager will serve as the key point of contact throughout the project and ensure all stakeholders are aware of upcoming deliverables and will ensure the project remains on track for launch. The implementation manager will track all tasks, including key milestones under the four key phases: initiation, requirements, testing/training, and go live readiness.   Our implementation process starts with an implementation kick-off meeting where the implementation manager review the overall timeline and key milestones for project deliverables.  Following the initial kick off meeting, the implementation manager will schedule a weekly or bi weekly status meeting which will be used as a working session and a status update meeting to provide stakeholders with and overall update on the project.  The implementation manager will also lead separate work stream meetings to cover different areas as needed.  Key deliverables required from an employer may include: Eligibility File - Minimal data is needed to establish eligibility. During implementation we will review the minimum PII eligibility file spec and the file transfer options. Employers and/or Sequoia will be asked to create an introduction to all parties involved in the implementation. This may include account managers, data warehouse constituents, PBM, and consultants.

","All communications will be highly customized to meet the client’s specific needs. Our playbook contains materials and communication recommendations based on what has worked well for client launches and how we know our members engage and interact with us depending on their unique fertility and family planning journey.  During the implementation and at launch, Kindbody will conduct a communication discovery where we will provide a marketing playbook that outlines Kindbody’s multi-pronged approach to kicking off the partnership, while increasing appropriate engagement. Our playbook includes: Kick-off announcement Targeted marketing outreach, based on claims data/demographics/personas Emails Social Ads Digital signage Text campaigns Brochures Postcards One-pagers Member guides, explanation of benefits Customized web portal and mobile app Virtual events - ie.

Our signature event is hosted by Kindbody's founding physician and includes the need-to-knows about fertility and family-building options and an overview of the specific benefits offered through the employer.  With all of our events, we will evaluate the effectiveness by measuring how many employees participate and how many are engaging with us (i.e. signing up for Kindbody or booking an appointment).  Kindbody will also provide a member benefit guide, describing all the details of the benefit as well as how to sign up and utilize your benefit. For launch and beyond, we provide additional communications, educational information, webinars and other initiatives to drive member engagement.

",F_eu380wzQea95S3s,Kindbody Member Marketing Examples.pdf,3143100,application/pdf,"We work with our consulting partners and employer clients to design inclusive benefits so that all employees have access to fertility, family building and reproductive health services. Our goal is to offer the most inclusive and equitable benefit for all. Kindbody creates or enhances plan designs to remove unintentional discrimination by lifting infertility requirements to access medical benefits. This allows same sex couples, single parents by choice and anyone encountering resistance under traditional coverage to be able to have equitable benefits for all. In addition, Kindbody recommends offering adoption/donor/surrogacy benefits at equal dollar value for cost parity to fertility/medical coverage. This truly supports inclusive benefits and all paths to parenthood.  When employees start working with Kindbody and our clinical staff, we must appropriately mimic the demographic we are serving. It is important that patients feel comfortable with their care team and that they feel seen, heard and understood. It is critical that our network welcomes LGBTQ+ patients, as well as minorities and single parents by choice. Thus, we use diversity as a very important part of our hiring process and ensure we hire for a diverse staff. Likewise, we look for partner clinics with a similar priority for diversity.   We welcome, empower and support heterosexual and LGBTQ+ couples as well as single parents, across all backgrounds, creating access to services through our integrative and holistic spectrum of care. Approximately 15% of Kindbody's patients identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community and 45% identify as BIPOC. With intention, our team has the ability to identify with the members they are serving.  We effortlessly nurture all paths to parenthood from natural conception support, to donor and surrogacy, adoption, and assisted reproductive technology. Additionally, we want to educate on reproductive health and assist members who are looking to preserve their fertility in hopes of starting a family in the future or need clinical and holistic support in their reproductive years i.e. menopause. .   From the beginning, we want to understand our members and gather information such as one's biological sex and preferred gender/pronouns so Kindbody can acknowledge all nuances that may exist in their identity. Our Care Navigators are equipped with empathy and broad knowledge to drive education and insight.  We also host regular community-focused events covering a range of family-building topics including LGBTQ+ family building and race and fertility, that promote understanding, solidarity and hope across all family-building pathways. At the employer level, we welcome collaboration with an organization’s internal BRG's to ensure cohesive and relevant engagement opportunities are understood and communicated thoughtfully.   Kindbody is committed to closing the gap on healthcare disparities. We achieve this by eliminating medical necessity in benefit design, improving access by lowering costs, providing education, targeting awareness about reproductive health and fertility issues to men and women of color and the LGBTQ+community, and giving a voice to these underrepresented populations.

Kindbody typically recommends that self-funded employers adopt an integrated solution for ease of administration and to keep all medical dollars in one place, as well as for ERISA and ACA compliance purposes.  - Under an integrated benefit model, Kindbody integrates with the group health plan and ERISA rules are met by the major medical plan with Kindbody providing the required reporting information needed.  - Under a standalone or HRA model, Kindbody is responsible for meeting ERISA rules.  If an employer chooses not to integrate with the employer’s group health plan, we typically recommend an “integrated” HRA per applicable law (i.e., not literally/practically integrated but considered in conjunction with a group major medical plan for ERISA and ACA compliance purposes). Kindbody can provide a sample attestation for certification of other group medical coverage and a sample HRA plan document.  Alternatively, if the employer wants to implement a standalone benefit or HRA, we typically suggest that the standalone benefit/HRA only be offered to employees enrolled in the group health plan for ERISA and ACA compliance purposes.  More specific information is provided below:  Integrated Carve Out Eligible: medical plan members only ERISA/ACA compliance: Extension of group health plan coverage Kindbody fertility benefit program is offered as an integrated benefit with the member’s group health plan. Cost share is applied to claims submitted to the carrier and is counted towards the member’s accumulators under the member’s health plan. During implementation, our carrier integrations team works with the medical carrier(s) to suppress all fertility codes from coverage within the health plan and we establish an integrated claims submission workflow with the carrier/TPA. As an integrated carve out, Kindbody integrates with the TPA/major medical who maintains the ultimate ERISA responsibilities. We will provide a description of our fertility services that can be used within plan documents/summary plan descriptions. To support our employer groups with their DOL filing, we provide a description of our fertility services that can be used within plan documents/summary plan descriptions.  Standalone Benefit or Integrated HRA Eligible: medical plan members, medical waivers, and/or other employee populations (e.g., Kaiser) ERISA/ACA compliance: Requires an employee to verify that the employee is enrolled in a group health plan in order to provide them with the Kindbody fertility benefit. Kindbody fertility benefit program is offered as a full carve out, separate from the member’s health plan. Because there is no integration, accumulators will not be applied and therefore, any cost share/deductibles will be in addition to their already existing health plan cost share/deductibles. Incurred fertility services fees would be a direct bill back to the employer, less any member responsibility. In order to assist customers with verifying that the employee is enrolled in another group health plan, we have an attestation box in the registration flow in our portal where the employee will attest to meeting the requirements of being enrolled in a group health plan (whether their employers or their spouse’s or partner’s group health plan).

It is at the discretion of the employer if they elect to offer non-medical benefits i.e. adoption, surrogacy reimbursement as a covered COBRA benefit.  During implementation we will determine the best approach to verify eligibility.  Some of our clients are able to pass the eligibility of COBRA enrollees on their eligibility file for active employees, while others opt for Kindbody to directly verify with the COBRA administrator. We are flexible with the process to verify COBRA enrollees.   While we do not establish COBRA rates, we understand that these rate estimates are based on the actuarial projected cost of the fertility benefit. The premium may be calculated based on a reasonable estimate of the cost of providing coverage. We are happy to assist an employer with projected cost of the program based on plan design, eligibility, and utilization in order for them to determine their rates.

We ensure compliance by making sure our team undergoes routine training and that each employee has an executive team member where they can seek guidance and clarity to ensure compliance.  Kindbody works with ERISA counsel to ensure compliance with the ACA and all applicable rules and regulations. As an integrated carve out solution with a client's self-funded medical plan, Kindbody complies with ACA requirements so long as the underlying plan meets the applicable requirements (eligibility, affordability, reporting. etc.). This includes ensuring members on HDHPs are meeting their deductible to maintain HSA contribution eligibility. Furthermore, we provide recommended language for the employer and carrier to update plan documents/SPDs.  Employers do have the option to expand coverage to non-medical plan members. Members who are not enrolled in medical coverage do have to show enrollment in another group health plan to be eligible for medical benefits in order to satisfy ACA compliance.

Maven covers the largest population globally of any fertility solution, enabled by the largest engineering and clinical team in the fertility industry - with ~150 engineers (1 in 4 employees) and ~150+ on-staff clinical/administrative team members (vs. others who are staffed mostly in operational and clinic administration departments). Our innovative, 24/7 platform offers members access to the clinical, emotional, and financial support they need to build their families and thrive. We take a member-centric approach to fill gaps in care and are the only platform with depth in care management and improved clinical outcomes from family building through menopause and beyond.   With Maven, employers delivery a single, holistic solution that integrates all reproductive health and family forming benefits.   Our approach to fertility & family building is unique in the following three ways:   1.) End-to-end care from family building through menopause: Maven delivers compassionate, equitable, and high quality care from preconception and family-building to pregnancy, postpartum, return-to-work, parenting, menopause and beyond. Maven is the only platform that delivers both breadth across the health and family journey, while also delivering depth in terms of clinical rigor. No other vendor has designed and built all programs from the ground-up, in-house with the same relentless focus on member experience (i.e. others have grown via partnerships with other vendors leading to a disjointed member and client experience).   2.) Member-first approach to family building: Maven is not incentivized to recommend costly and invasive treatment that drives profit, instead we ensure members get the right care at the right time, which may look like preventative preconception care, continuous and unlimited mental health support through the family building journey, or treatment if/when it’s necessary at the highest quality clinics within the Maven Performance Network. Our care model is inclusive of all paths to parenthood, and ensures all Comcast employees have access to the highest quality care.          -Up to 25% of fertility members achieve pregnancy without assisted reproductive technology         -40% of Maven’s 850+ providers identify as Latine, Black/African American, Asian, Middle Eastern or Multi-Racial; 11% of specialists identify as LGBTQIA+         -0% Maven markups on treatment costs  3.) Proven outcomes at scale: Maven supports members across their clinical, emotional and financial needs in a single platform - driving high member engagement. High engagement translates to better clinical outcomes for members and cost savings for Comcast. Since day one, we've relentlessly prioritized member experience, understanding that high engagement translates to better outcomes vs. other vendors where member experience is an afterthought.

These teams have a strong track record as evidenced by our 96% client retention rate and 92 implementation NPS score.   Below are the key components of Maven's implementation process:     -Eligibility and Reporting: In order to verify access to the platform, Maven ingests eligibility files. During implementation, Maven will partner with the client or vendor to establish and safely transfer eligibility files to Maven via a secure SFTP connection.    -Benefits Integration: The aim of this stage is to integrate with the client's existing benefits. The information collected is used to train the Maven Care team and customize the product for a client's employees. Maven Care Advocates are trained on our client’s existing benefits so they are able to direct members to the most appropriate resources such as in-network, in-person providers.    -Member Communications: During this last stage, Maven and the client will work together on developing a communications strategy for launch and ongoing communications. Maven will create all the creative materials for the client and will work with their team to establish a communications timeline as well as a deployment strategy for all communications. Maven works directly with clients to make sure launch communications are tailored to their employee audience to ensure a successful launch.    -Legal, privacy, and security reviews: Maven will work the client on the required legal, privacy and security reviews. As part of this process, we will identify any possible impact the reviews will have on meeting implementation deadlines and ensuring an on-time launch.  Maven will manage the majority of the implementation process, ensuring deliverables and milestones are achieved on time.

Maven gives employers the opportunity to provide their employees with increased access to care that meets their needs and fills gaps left by traditional health systems.   The Maven solution:     -Increases access to hard to reach specialists: The needs of expecting parents and their families extend beyond what can be covered in a standard 15-minute OB-GYN or pediatrician appointment. Members benefit from the ability to connect with a range of specialty care providers throughout their family journey, including doulas, midwives, birth planning specialists, mental health therapists, lactation consultants, and more.                >Access to providers trained in delivering culturally competent care. Trainings done both internally and through Maven's partnership with Violet. Violet trains care teams on health literacy, cultural humility, and the unique needs, challenges, and healthcare disparities that exist within and across diverse populations    -Offers designated tracks for all paths to parenthood: Maven's end-to-end programs are inclusive of all paths to parenthood, including adoption and surrogacy, which is especially important for same-sex couples.     -Provides care-matching based on identity and background: Maven's virtual network includes over 850+ providers across 30 specialties. They speak 35+ languages, 40% of practitioners identify as Latine, Black/African American, Asian, Middle Eastern or Multi-Racial and 11% identify as LGBTQIA+. To ensure our network remains diverse and meets the needs of the populations that we serve. Members can choose to be matched with providers based on background, race, and ethnicity    -Recognizes and addresses barriers to care: During onboarding, members are screened for unmet social needs in order to help our Care Advocates better understand a member's situation with respect to unmet needs and connect them to community based resources as needed and customize a member's Care Team with providers such as doulas, diabetic coaches, and MFM's, who are known to improve outcomes but are inaccessible in many areas             >Maven's SDoH Screener: Maven-developed SDoH screening - 3 question screening allows care teams to understand a member's social needs without being burdensome. Results of effectiveness are close to par with the industry gold standard, Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patients’ Assets, Risks, and Experiences (PRAPARE).    -Community resources: Access to local community based organizations, resources, and online communities within the Maven platform, which helps increase health literacy, ease feelings of isolation, and empower members.     -Educational resources: Offering access to clinically-backed resources can help to improve health literacy and empower members in healthcare situations.    -Personalized referrals: When needed, Maven can provide trusted, vetted referrals to top-rated in-person care based on background, preferences, and location. For example, LGBTQIA+-friendly adoption agencies, fertility clinics, in-person providers.    Within Maven, we promote the following DE&I initiatives among our own team.     -Allies in Equity: Maven's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Neel Shah, moderates a bimonthly Q&A for Maven employees and providers focused on health equity, featuring healthcare leaders, advocates and community members who discuss their work progressing health equity and the importance of access to quality care.    -Anti-Racism Challenge: Maven hosts an annual month-long Anti-Racism Challenge for employees to broaden their perspectives and better equip Mavens to be anti-racists, through self-reflection, learning and connection. This annual event results in over 500 cumulative hours of anti-racism education at Maven.  Additionally, Maven's believes that community-based organizations (CBOs) are essential to addressing the many disparities we see in maternal health across the United States. In partnership with March for Moms, we launched MPact for Families, a new program to invest in community-based organizations (CBOs) advancing maternal health. The program provides financial, mentoring, and skill support to community-based organizations that are filling gaps in the traditional health care system, and building the trust within their communities that is core to delivering better health outcomes.  Through MPact for Families, Maven and March for Moms currently support two organizations:     -Village of Healing offers a new approach to community wellness through Cuyahoga County’s first and only medical center focused on the health of Black women. The Village of Healing Center delivers quality health care services that meet the social and cultural needs of patients in the greater Cleveland community by offering gynecology, obstetrics, mental health services, telehealth, and community programs.      -Breath of My Heart Birthplace is a midwifery care clinic and birth center in the Española Valley of New Mexico. Through its free walk-in clinic, birth services, and holistic fertility and preconception care, Breath of My Heart meets the needs of birthing people and families before, during, and after birth.

Employers are able to customize fertility benefit plan designs according to their needs and preferences.   At a high level, our approach to designing a fertility & family building benefit alongside our client includes the following:     -Benefit design: Carve out with the Maven-Managed Fertility & Family Building program and health plan wrap around.     -Eligible population: Determining who will be eligible for the fertility benefit (e.g., all employees, or just those enrolled in the employer's medical plan(s)) as well as any criteria that will be required to access the benefit (e.g., a medical diagnosis of infertility). Note that Maven's clients typically do not require members to have an infertility diagnosis to access coverage through Maven Wallet.    -Eligible services: Defining what services will be covered. Maven provides a starting point for recommended covered services (e.g., fertility treatment consultations and diagnostics, treatments like IUI and IVF, as well as egg/sperm/embryo preservation, if desired).    -Benefit level: Maven is uniquely flexible in that we offer both Dollar Lifetime Max and Cycle-based benefits (Maven Cycles are only available in a carve-out scenario).

Lastly, Maven manages navigating the complexities of ACA and ERISA compliance for both our clients and our members including ensuring employees utilizing the fertility program are enrolled in a health plan that meets minimum coverage requirements either through their employer or a spouse's employer.

With Cleo's global care team and digital platform, our support stands out with the following:  A population health approach to support family caregivers across all 5 stages of caregiving: awareness stage (for those early in the caregiving journey who may not even self-identify as a caregiver); responsibility stage (for those supporting family members with day-to-day functional activities); growing demand stage (for family caregivers who are at high risk for burn out); end of life stage (for those who need support with advance care planning, palliative and hospice care and making final arrangements; bereavement stage (supporting families during their grief and planning for what's next).

This model allows Cleo to engage with a broader population proactively, helping them address not only their current needs but also plan for near-future needs with the goal of preventing avoidable urgent events or issues (e.g., falls in the home, determining advance directives, finding home care providers), which ultimately results in better health outcomes for the caregiver(s) and care recipient(s). ",2,"No minimum for partnership through Sequoia.

Leveraging 8 years of helping customers build over $3B in savings, Stash is now also partnering with employers to make it easy and fun for their employees to save money. For most people saving money is hard and feels out of reach. Lack of meaningful savings creates stress and impacts employees’ physical, mental, and professional well-being. StashWorks solves this problem - giving employees the ability to automatically deduct money from their paychecks, effortlessly save for life goals, and earn cash rewards for making consistent contributions and hitting “savings streaks.” With no minimum balance or contribution requirements, no fee banking services, and no AUM fees, StashWorks makes it easy to get started and stick with it for the long run. We’re fully integrated with all major payroll systems, ensuring a set up that takes just minutes for employers and employees. Nearly 90% of working Americans saying they would participate in a workplace savings tool and 60% saying they’d be more likely to stay at a job that offered financial wellness benefits - StashWorks is on a mission to become the most utilized benefit and effective employee engagement solution. What makes us different? Combination of education and action: Unlike most providers in the financial benefits space, StashWorks offers both financial education and actionable accounts, tools and solutions. We call it “earn as you learn” and the experience is designed to help users utilize our financial content to take empowered, informed actions based on learnings. Focus on savings and investing, accessible funds and portable accounts: Across every segment of the population, people are most concerned about the amount of money they have saved for emergencies. To this end, unlike many other providers in the space employees can choose from a variety of products and solutions including, savings and investing as well as retirement planning. In addition, we have integrations with all major payroll providers and can power automatic deductions from employees’ paychecks for deposit into a Stash account. Stash accounts move with employees so there is no work for employers to facilitate transitions. Whether employees are just surviving or thriving, Stash puts employees in the driver’s seat and gives them choice, access to their funds, and ease of portability. Innovative, attractive rewards: StashWorks is a first of its kind benefit that offers innovative rewards through sign up incentives, milestone rewards (i.e “savings streaks”) and spend based perks all with the goal of providing near term and long term value, encouraging enrollment and optimizing for long term engagement. The rewards are branded, positioned and messaged as a ‘perk’ and convey a sense of optimism, levity and ‘value’ (i.e. a smart way to get ahead in life). The goal is to leverage a rewards driven experience to help turn money into a source of hope and opportunity.

That's why our communication strategy is powered by one of the most sophisticated algorithms in the market, ingesting more than 30 different data points (e.g. claims, sociodemographic variables, census data, etc.) to generate a personalized approach that meets people at the right time, via the right channels (SMS vs. email vs in-app / push notifications), with the right message. That means that depending on a member's health status, needs, goals, how they're interacting with the platform, etc. they'll receive their own unique mix and cadence of communications.

We also tailor personalized communications and custom messages based on employee needs which are more standardized messaging that has been clinically evaluated for messaging and recommendations.  Registration communications: communications sent to encourage members to register for the application  Triggered communications: communications that automatically get sent based on a member's actions in the platform (e.g. rewards redemption, receipt of a new claim, password reset, etc.)  Genius communications: personalized communications based on our sophisticated algorithm that help members achieve health outcomes and reduce total cost of care (e.g. breast cancer screening communications, chronic condition management communications, etc.).

We use the feedback to implement changes and improve our processes. We engage professional research firms to conduct telephonic satisfaction surveys on behalf of MetLife.  We are committed to the ongoing assessment of satisfaction among our clients and their employees through surveys. We review each concern to promote an environment of continuous improvement. We use survey results to identify coaching opportunities, training needs and possible process improvements for a specific customer, team, office or our product organizations as a whole. These surveys allow us to see when changes or process improvements are necessary.  Life Medallia, a professional research firm, conducts our quarterly telephonic satisfaction surveys of Life claimants. In 2022, 96.8% of claimants were satisfied or very satisfied with their Group Life claim experience.  This survey gauges perceptions of the following: •	Level of service that we provided on a recent claim; •	Ease of filing the claim; •	Claims turnaround time; •	Accuracy of payment; •	Toll-free service; •	Written communications; •	Satisfaction with our Total Control Account settlement option as a mode of payment (if applicable); •	Perceptions of claim transaction channels: mail, phone, IVR or online.  Dental The Dental Caller Satisfaction Survey polls a random sample of participants who recently called our toll-free customer service line. Participants are asked to provide their opinions on the outcome of the call, how satisfied they were with the level of customer service and how their experiences compared to calls with other customer service lines. The survey lasts six to seven minutes and results are reported monthly. In 2022, 90% of participants were very satisfied or satisfied with the overall call center service.  Our Plan Participant Satisfaction Survey has two components. The first component surveys a random sample of plan participants who filed a dental claim in the last two months.

In 2022, our overall PPO participant satisfaction rate was 95%, and 95% of participants were very satisfied or satisfied with their overall claims service.  Our Managed Dental Plan survey monitors satisfaction among participants in areas of perceived value, service quality and network, particularly in regard to choice of dentists, quality of care and access.

The first part of the survey is conducted among a random sample of participants who filed a vision claim in the prior two months. The second part of the survey is conducted among a random sample of patients who visited a preferred provider during selected months. Both parts of the survey are conducted monthly by telephone and results are reported quarterly.  The survey provides participants with an opportunity to voice their opinions regarding the Vision program, and both participating and non-participating providers. It also allows us to identify opportunities for improvement in our services and overall satisfaction of participating providers.  Following are our overall satisfaction results for respondents surveyed in 2022: •	MetLife Vision VSP Network: 98% were either satisfied or very satisfied with their overall vision program; •	MetLife Vision Davis Network: 100% were either satisfied or very satisfied with their overall vision program; •	MetLife Vision Superior Network: 94% were either satisfied or very satisfied with their overall vision program.  Voluntary Benefits (Accident & Health) We mail a satisfaction survey to all approved claimants.

Health Savings & Spending Accounts Caller satisfaction surveys are completed across the MetLife customer base after customer service interactions. Each time a participant called in 2022, they were invited to participate in a short three-question survey that we used to monitor overall performance. We have modified this survey beginning in 2023 to further enhance customer satisfaction.   Based on results in 2022, we have received positive feedback for each of these three questions below: •	On a scale of 1-5, 5 being the best, how would you rate the courteousness and professionalism of the representative that you just spoke with? (average  3.6); •	On a scale of 1-5, 5 being the best, how would you rate the ability of the representative to explain the information in a manner that is easy to understand? (average 3.5); •	You just called our Customer Service Center to address a specific question or concern. Was your question or concern resolved the first time you called?

The question asked in the NPS survey is “How likely are you to recommend MetLife Legal Plans to a colleague?”  Our Client Service Center in Cleveland, Ohio serves as an immediate “feedback loop” for participants who call with questions and concerns. We aggregate telephonic feedback and review monthly to identify any re-occurring issues or trends.  MetLife Pet Insurance Our Pet customers are given a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey. NPS is an industry- Net Promoter Score (NPS) is an industry wide calculation and has been proven to be an effective way to gauge customer loyalty. MetLife asks a single question to gather the data required to calculate NPS. “How likely are you to recommend MetLife to a friend or colleague?”  Those who respond to the question with a 9 or 10 are classified as promoters. Those who respond with a 0 to 6 are detractors. The percentage of detractors is subtracted from the percentage of promoters to get the NPS. For example, if 70% of responders are promoters, 10% are passives and 20% are detractors, then the company’s NPS would be 50 (70 - 20 = 50).  The Regional Market Net Promoter Score is 38.

",,,,,,,,1,Our most recent Regional Market Customer Net Promoter Score (NPS) is 38.,,"Our implementation process follows a consistent and structured approach that promotes positive outcomes.  All Implementation Leaders use a Web-based project plan to monitor all implementation deliverables. The detailed project plan tracks due dates and accountability of the owners of each item. Each member of the implementation team is required to update the project plan as tasks are completed. The Implementation Leader is responsible for ensuring that implementation team members complete their assigned tasks by the due date. Key tasks are linked to an aggregate reporting system that allows the management team to react promptly if a target milestone is in jeopardy.  A comprehensive Implementation Guide is created for each customer to provide an overview of the end-to-end process. The guide is presented at the initial implementation meeting and outlines the implementation schedule, key tasks, responsible parties and target dates. The presentation of the guide and discussion of key tasks is crucial in setting expectations. Subsequent follow-up meetings are scheduled to ensure that all parties are remaining on target with their key deliverables.  During the process, several quality assurance checks are conducted to ensure we have accurately finalized the plan design. These checks are done during the system set-up, contract production and system finalization. This ensures the accuracy of the information being loaded against the final system production information and contractual documents.  Lastly, customers are surveyed about their case installation experience. The results of these surveys are used to evaluate the implementation process and recognize opportunities for improvement. Implementation team members’ performance evaluations and compensation are directly impacted by these survey results.  We have enclosed sample implementation schedules with our response. A more completed and customized implementation schedule, including detailed tasks and responsibilities for the customer’s selected coverage(s), will be developed for each customer’s initial implementation meeting.",F_2tDcx1VOSgUSzsZ,24.

Diversity also helps us better understand our markets across the world and build stronger relationships with our customers and the communities where we live and work.  The key drivers of our Global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) strategy are talent and commercial opportunities. The strategy is focused on three key strategic pillars:  •	Attraction – Identifying top diverse talent;  •	Development and Advancement – Developing our diverse workforce; and  •	Retention – Retaining our best talent to ensure high business performance and high workforce engagement.  To ensure that our DE&I efforts are sustained for the long term, we have established a Global Diversity and Inclusion Council chaired by our CEO. The primary focus of the council is to oversee the development and implementation of our DE&I strategy around the world. We launched four regional DE&I Task Forces – in Asia, EMEA, Latin America and the U.S. – sponsored by the regional presidents and chaired by regional representatives from the Global DE&I Council. The Task Forces focus on the implementation of the strategy at the regional and country levels and their members represent a cross-section of the businesses and functions in each region.  Our Diversity Business Resource Networks (DBRNs) are groups of employee volunteers who promote awareness, respect and inclusion of our key populations. These networks provide personal and professional development opportunities to our employees. In addition, they create and support business-driven initiatives aligned to the company’s business and DE&I strategies.  The seven DBRNs include: •	Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Associates and Allies at MetLife (GLAM); •	Rising Professionals at MetLife (iRISE); •	MetLife Diverse Abilities (MDA); •	MetLife Veterans Network (MVET); •	Multicultural Professionals Network (MPN); •	Women’s Business Network (WBN); •	Families at MetLife (FAM).  Our Global Women’s Initiative (GWI) is focused on increasing the representation of women in leadership roles and strengthening the leadership capability of women in our talent pipeline. To attract, engage and develop female leaders, we have implemented the following programs: •	Women’s Business Networks: a global community of voluntary employee-led groups in more than 30 countries, focused on career development and engagement activities for women; •	The International Women’s Day Forum; an annual webcast celebrating the contributions of women globally enabling employees around the world to connect with influential thought leaders; •	Developing Women’s Careers Experience: a nomination-based program that emboldens women’s leadership aspirations, preparing them to move into leadership roles; •	Peer Mentoring Circles; employee-facilitated career discussion groups (Lean In) and peer groups for MetLife employees with children under the age of one to help them navigate their return-to-work following parental leave (Mom Circles).  Additionally, we have Local Inclusion Action Teams (LIATs) that exist in over 20 locations in the U.S. and one in India. LIATs support business initiatives that encourage an inclusive environment at the local level.  These groups have held events such as “lunch-n-learns” to discuss topics related to people with disabilities, the multi-generational workforce and cross-cultural communication. Gatherings are also held to honor events like Black History Month, Women’s History Month, Pride Month, Diversity Awareness Month and Autism Awareness.

Implementation can occur at almost any time of year, and typically takes no longer than 4 weeks.  During implementation, the client and account manager will accomplish the following:  - Benefit Portal Setup  - Eligibility file upload/testing enrollment flow (must be done 2 weeks prior to launch) - Communication timeline and channels (timeline will be based on client's needs) - Review marketing assets, welcome video, photography/logos, etc  ",F_2EtwcRx94h6idcN,Peloton Implementation Timeline.png,50829,image/png,1,"Peloton’s agreements with clients typically continue for a period of one year from the program launch date as agreed upon.

Peloton does not offer termination for convenience.","Peloton delivers industry-high engagement by focusing on various communication touchpoints throughout an employees’ journey. Communication strategy is different for every client, however we leverage a proven toolkit and playbook to address each of our client's communication needs. We focus on continuous communication through 2 key phases:  Enrollment: Peloton is committed to providing an inclusive benefit that offers something for everyone at every level. We provide a comprehensive communications toolkit, coupled with a launch & engagement plan that sustains excitement among employees. As employees are deemed as eligible by their ‘start date’ in the eligibility file provided by their employers, Peloton sends a one-time welcome email that describes the benefit and provides directions on how to enroll. Peloton can send follow-up emails to employees who have yet to activate their benefit, and will work with a client on the appropriate cadence for these communications. Peloton also leverages other company communication methods to increase awareness and adoption (i.e. messaging channels, executive sponsorship, company meetings, etc.). Here are some examples of how Peloton helps clients drive benefit enrollment and first-touch engagement: - Peloton provides the first class in the employee onboarding process - a 5 minute yoga or meditation class - to educate employees on how accessible Peloton classes are, and encourage them to continue to engage.  - Peloton can provide consultation support for company-wide launch event programming to generate awareness (i.e. all-hands meeting announcement, webinars, etc.)   Engagement: Peloton offers multiple engagement touchpoints at the company, team, and individual levels – and partners with clients to ensure that our engagement strategy is aligned with your company culture:  Company-level: - Company-wide activity challenges (available for employers with >1k employees): All employees enrolled in the benefit can participate in activity-based challenges with Peloton. Challenges are typically based on the number of classes/active days or minutes that an employee engages with Peloton, to ensure flexibility and accessibility. Challenge finishers are rewarded with custom company badges, and we can work with clients to offer additional incentives.  - Cultural moments & DEI support: Peloton produces content in support of cultural celebrations throughout the year. Our client success team can help tie Peloton into cultural celebrations such as Black History Month, Mental Health Awareness Month, Pride Month, and more.  - Tags: Peloton can help set up a company Tag so members of a workforce can interact with one another.  - High-Fives: Coworkers can offer encouragement when taking a class together.   Team-level: - Team Classes: Peloton provides assets that enable ambassadors or team leaders to facilitate team-specific classes. Peloton’s scheduling feature allows Members to schedule a class and send an invite to coworkers or friends to join them on the Leaderboard.  - Wellness Breaks: Peloton can support teams in blocking time for employees to engage in recommended activities such as meditation classes for a mental health break, stretches for a mobility break, outdoor team walks/runs, etc.  - Tags: Tags can also be created for specific teams within an organization so that Members can stay connected with one another in a more intimate setting.   Individual-level: - Peloton offers targeted outreach to enrolled Members (via email, push notifications) to recommend new content, encourage them to take their first class, keep their daily/weekly streak going, hit their next milestone, join a company/community challenge, and more.  - Streaks: Peloton helps Members stay motivated by awarding them for daily and weekly streaks of activity.  - Achievements: Members are rewarded with special badges for completing milestone classes (i.e. 10th class, 50th class, 100th class, etc.), programs, or special activities/themed classes.  - Programs: Programs can be recommended to help Members achieve a personal goal within a certain time frame. Members can track their progress and stay on track based on an instructor’s guidance.  - Personalization features: Peloton’s User Interface leverages machine learning to recommend classes and content based on a Member’s engagement and preferences.

The XP Health program focuses on  Technology and Innovation: XP Health has built the world’s first smart vision care platform.  We use artificial intelligence and augmented reality to create a curated, personalized experience for selecting eyewear and have innovated to provide virtual access to care.   Lower costs eyewear for members:  Unlike traditional vision options, our business model is not structured to profit from eyewear sales.   XP Health provides access to high-quality frames and best-in-class lenses at vertically integrated wholesale costs.   By removing the physical retail overhead, staff, and idle inventory, our average member out-of-pocket is just $42, compared to $230 with traditional plans.  We source directly from OEM manufacturers for major eyewear players, and pass on the savings directly to members.   Intelligent Vision Care Journey: XP Health includes a robust national vision network that covers in-person eye exams ($0 copay) at 99,000+ providers (retail and private practice), in-person discounts, online prescription renewal, and revolutionary pricing through XP online marketplace.

All plans include a $0 cost for access to doctor-recommended lenses and enhancements, included with every eyewear purchase (advanced blue-light protection, advanced anti-glare protection, UV protection and scratch-resistant coating). All plans include access to account management, marketing communication support and a dedicated Concierge Team.  We have two primary products (each offer a configurable eyewear benefit:  1.) Virtual Vision Care:  This includes access to the XP Marketplace for Eyewear.  This is typically deployed as a value added plan that would be in addition to a traditional vision plan.   2.). Total Vision Care: Includes access to the XP Marketplace and the Vision Care Platform, which includes an eye exam benefit and an online prescription renewal service.

Earning members’ trust and delivering exceptional customer service means that in situations that are unclear, that lead to confusion or questions, we consistently err on the side of our members.   In addition to policy drivel elements (like a 30-day no-questions-asked return policy for our eyewear), we have reimbursed members for scheduling an exam outside of our eye exam network (for Total Vision Care Clients), sent them free eyewear if they identified a confusing or erroneous element related to our member experience, or allowed members to add a dependent in excess of our contracted amount when we felt that action would reflect our values and commitment to member experience.   For client organizations, we pride ourselves on maintaining a level of personal care, partnership, and flexibility that redefines traditional standards of the industry.   In addition to building custom vision plans to accommodate budgets and well-being goals, offering dedicated account management resources, and as frequent as weekly reporting, we have helped our clients transition vision plans mid-year, adjust benefit levels, added coverage for new populations, recruited additional providers to our network, added eyewear inventory to our store, and even offered free XP Health eyewear as an incentive for employees to learn about other benefit changes that our clients were implementing.   Coming through for our clients is at the core of what we do and will continue doing. ","All of our customer service team members have prior member services experience and are regularly trained and re-trained on our standards.

Flexibility for employers: Every business is different, so our solution was designed to be highly configurable, allowing us to match each customer's unique workflow, regardless of size or complexity.  Flexibility for employees: Immediate maximizes the options employees have for when and where they want to receive a funds transfer.  Responsibility: Immediate uses guardrails to give employees access to the money they have earned without exposing them to the risk of receiving a zero dollar paycheck.  The earned wage access industry has become one focused on giving employees virtually unlimited access to their wages with the talk track of 'it's your money, use it when you need it.' However, Immediate feels this approach is predatory in nature as it encourages an abundance of transactions which deduct further from an employees paycheck. Furthermore, it promotes enablement for team members rather than responsible financial access with a focus on financial wellness.   Immediate practices what it promotes - financial wellness through responsible access to earned wages with need-based transactions while keeping funds with the employee and furthering their journey to financial freedom. ",1,"No headcount or payment minimums. ","Immediate is a voluntary, group benefit that has no required cost to the employer. Employees have multiple options which don’t carry any direct cost to them either. There is no fee to transfer funds to a gift card or to the Immediate card.  The only direct cost to the employee is if they choose to push funds directly to their personal bank account or debit card. In this scenario, standard pricing is $3 per transaction.   Furthermore, Immediate offers a solution for employees to support off-cycle paychecks to simplify the payroll team's processes. This model may carry a $1 - $3 fee depending on how (and if) the company utilizes this solution. It is not a requirement to utilize this service.  Immediate does not have any minimum utilization requirements, minimum spends for employers or employees, not contract term lengths or exclusivity requirements.   The easiest way to think about Immediate's services is a no cost/no obligation service for the employer to offer their employees where employees have the option for multiple free options to access their earned wages.

In addition to a standardized onboarding process with the aforementioned requirements, Immediate holds Empathy as one of its core values and the organization’s goal is to hire individuals that demonstrate this while monitoring it through ticket review, interaction reviews and active coaching.   As mentioned previously in Immediate’s reply, we believe our service, satisfaction, work and support are best demonstrated in the data that derives from our customers.

This is especially important in retaining top leadership & talent, and preventing the 'brain drain' & 'silent quitting' that happens when qualified women leave the workforce due to menopause.   Evernow is a virtual concierge care platform to support women in perimenopause, menopause & beyond. We provide unlimited access to dedicated menopause-certified providers, prescribe insurance-covered & evidence-based therapies, and have a digital platform (and mobile app) where women can get ongoing care anytime, anywhere. Understanding that menopause is often a 10-20 year journey, we have developed a subscription-based care model (with plans starting as low as $29/month). This allows us to provide dedicated and high quality, longitudinal care to women navigating an evolving suite of menopause symptoms -- providing highly individualized care and improving long-term outcomes.  In our space, you will see two main competitors -- telehealth companies that offer virtual visits for menopause, and fertility benefits companies that have developed shallow point-solutions as an extension of their care platforms. Neither is well positioned to effectively serve the complexity of a woman's transition through menopause.   Evernow Differentiators  1. Medical care from menopause specialists: Nearly 80% of PCPs / OBGYNs have expressed that their medical education was insufficient in preparing them to care for women in (peri)menopause, with <6 hours of menopause training during 4 years of residency. The symptoms are complex and required highly specialized care. All of Evernow's providers are licensed in the U.S. and have pursued additional certifications through The Menopause Society (formerly NAMs).  2. Longitudinal care model: Many women begin experiencing menopause symptoms -- (ie. brain fog, anxiety, weight gain, sleeplessness) as early as their 40's -- far before they hit 'menopause'. For some, the transition to menopause can last 5-10 years, which means navigating difficult symptoms over a long period of time. Telehealth companies and single-providers are set up to have a video visit and write a script. By pairing women with a dedicated menopause specialist, we are set up to care for women across their menopause journey in a high-touch and personalized way  3. Technology-driven care platform: We recognize that to best serve your employees and to be able to grow with you, we need to be highly scalable and accessible. Unlike other telehealth models -- that would have trouble rapidly scaling up to meet capacity -- we leverage an asynchronous care model for greater scalability, better accessibility & faster response to member needs. This, alongside our proprietary EHR system and mobile-app, puts us in a unique position to leverage technology for better care. Our EHR system helps every provider better serve their patients. And our mobile-app, where members can manage their experience (message their provider, track their symptoms, update their prescription, access exclusive content & more) allows us to meet your employees where they are and drive rapid response and accessibility when they need it most.  4. Data-driven personalization: We know that providing high-touch, personalized care is important to consumers; and can help drive better outcomes in the long term. Unlike some competitors, we are making deep investments in data and research, to be able to personalize care and optimize outcomes for every individual on our platform. To date, we have amassed the largest proprietary data set on (peri)menopause symptoms & resolution with treatment. Our research within this data, has already identified opportunities to tailor protcols around race, ethnicity and BMI that we are putting into practice, and leveraging to steer a new standard of care.   5. Affordability, convenience & insurance: Many telehealth companies that have partnered with insurance companies charge upwards of $200 per visit for those that are un-or-underinsured. On the contrary, the price of our monthly memberships (between $29 - $49/mo depending on your plan duration) are designed to be affordable, whether or not someone has insurance (our membership fees are also FSA & HSA eligible). Likewise, our medications are prescribed through your local pharmacy, so that you can conveniently apply commercial insurance & other discounts, and pick them up at your convenience.

We maintain a higher standard of care which includes not only coaching but direct financial advice.  This requires that Origin is registered as an investment advisor at the state and federal level which eliminates limitations on the direction and assistance we can deliver to employees.  We do not gate access to our network of licensed financial professionals or encourage a 'chat first' approach.  Employees can immediately and directly book time with a licensed financial professional of their choice.   Origin has the largest independent network of licensed financial professionals across the globe. We operate in 52+ countries and allow employees to meet 1-on-1, virtually, with their own dedicated financial professional in their specific jurisdiction.   Our planners speak the local language, are familiar with the local financial, tax and benefits systems, and have been thoroughly vetted and trained by our in-house team of Certified Financial Planners. Because of the network of licensed financial professionals we've built, we are able to put the human at the forefront of our offering and allow employees to book time directly on their financial professional's calendar, to work with the same dedicated financial professional over time, and provide options for employees to request to work with a financial planner with whom they can relate.   A critical differentiator for Origin is the fact that we incorporate employee benefits, retirement plan details, and other relevant information into the licensed financial professional-facing application. By integrating this information into the workflow of the Planner, we ensure that they highlight relevant benefits provided by the employer and write them into the customized financial plans that are created for each employee. Origin has raised over $70 million in venture capital funding from investors such as General Catalyst, Founders Fund and Felicis.  We have invested in building the world's largest network of financial planning professionals, as well as a team of 70+ product and engineering team members (alumni from Uber, Goldman Sachs, Citi, Spotify and Deloitte to name a few) to ensure that we are providing employees with a best-in-class experience.  Origin's philosophy surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion is to provide every individual with financial tools and resources regardless of race, gender, background, financial literacy or net worth.  We take a human-first approach by connecting every employee 1:1 with a Certified Financial Planner through a diverse network that is 22% more diverse than the US Certified Financial Planner community and represents a higher concentration of female, BIPOC, LGBTQ+ and bi-lingual financial planners.  Our network is also diverse by way of specialty areas such as divorce, single parents, military members and faith-based planning to name a few.   Origin's strong commitment to diversity and inclusion is reflected by Origin's Diversity Program whose mission is bridging the financial literacy gap by providing diverse financial planners and financial education to underserved communities including scholarships for aspiring CFPs.  Origin has realized an average of 31% engagement across our book of business.  Origin has developed an ongoing, multi-channeled approach for employee engagement which includes various modes and frequencies of communication.  All customers are assigned a dedicated Customer Experience Team with the distinct focus of delivering an exceptional customer experience that drives engagement.  We begin by providing a custom launch campaign which includes launch flyers in multiple languages, a benefit guide that contains FAQ's and drip campaigns, welcome invitations sent to employees on activation day, launch webinars and benefit announcement language to be included on the customers' intranet.  Ongoing engagement tactics include monthly emails to all eligible employees with rewards and topical financial news, Teams integration for Origin education application, joint press releases and referral programs.

We offer flexibility to accommodate the employers budget.   The PEPM is also differentiated based on US vs International employees as there are nuances to the Origin offering based on those populations. The PEPM is slightly higher for international employees as there is a premium for Origin building the largest planner network on the globe with local planners in over 50 countries.

Origin has a comprehensive system in place to track and measure our service delivery, ensuring that we meet and exceed our clients' expectations. Our approach involves using various key metrics to assess performance and accuracy. Here's an overview of our process:  1. Key Metrics:    - Service Level Agreements (SLAs): We establish SLAs with our clients to define response times, resolution times, and other service-related commitments. These SLAs serve as critical benchmarks for tracking performance.    - Customer Satisfaction (CSAT): We regularly collect feedback from our clients through surveys to measure their satisfaction with our services. This helps us understand their experiences and make improvements.    - Net Promoter Score (NPS): NPS surveys are used to gauge client loyalty and overall satisfaction. We track NPS scores over time to identify trends and areas for enhancement.    - Incident Resolution Time: We monitor the time it takes to resolve specific issues or incidents reported by our clients. This metric ensures that we address concerns promptly.    - Accuracy of Deliverables: We assess the accuracy of our deliverables through various means, such as comparing data output to client expectations and conducting quality control checks.  2. Data Gathering:    - Ticketing System: We use a robust ticketing system to track and manage client requests, incidents, and inquiries. This system collects data on response and resolution times automatically.    - Client Surveys: We regularly distribute client surveys, including CSAT and NPS surveys, to gather feedback directly from our clients.    - Quality Control Checks: Our internal quality control processes involve manual reviews and validations of deliverables to ensure accuracy.  3. Calculation of Metrics:    - SLA Metrics: SLA metrics, including response times and resolution times, are calculated based on the timestamps recorded in our ticketing system. We compute these metrics using predefined formulas.    - CSAT and NPS Scores: CSAT and NPS scores are calculated based on the responses received from client surveys. CSAT is typically measured on a scale of 1-5 or 1-7, while NPS is based on a 0-10 scale.    - Incident Resolution Time: This metric is calculated by measuring the time elapsed from the initial reporting of an incident to its successful resolution.  Our commitment to data-driven decision-making allows us to continually assess and improve our service delivery. We regularly analyze these metrics, identify trends, and collaborate with our clients to implement process enhancements and ensure the highest level of service quality and accuracy.  Additionally, members can send a message directly on the Origin platform via live chat. For customers seeking immediate assistance through our Live Chat feature, we guarantee a response within 1 minute during our regular business hours. In case the Live Chat request is made outside of our regular business hours, or while an agent is on break, we will respond within 1 minute of the start of the next business day. Members can also email hereforyou@useorigin.com if they have questions. Our team is dedicated to responding to customer emails promptly. We commit to providing a resolution or acknowledgment within 60 minutes of receiving the email during our regular business hours. If an email is received outside of our regular business hours, the response will be provided within 60 minutes of the start of the next business day. ","Origin's network of licensed financial professionals includes 350+ globally. All of our US and international financial professionals, where applicable, hold the Certified Financial Planner designation which is maintained by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards. This designation is regarded as the highest level of certification for members of the personal financial planning community. In countries where the CFP credential is not available, we have made every effort to employ financial professionals that have an equivalent financial certification or advanced degree in a financial discipline. Members of our network of financial professionals must adhere to our code of conduct and complete a multi-step process that includes proprietary training and ongoing supervision.   A key differentiator for Origin is that we can create a network of financial planners in new countries within 90 days.  Origin sources financial professional candidates ourselves via referrals from our current network and proactive outreach.  Should these individuals meet our stringent vetting requirements, we invite them to our proprietary training program with a target go-live date within 90 days.    A Brief overview of our process is as follows: 1. Direct and referral-based licensed financial professional sourcing 2. Interview Process 3. Credential Verification 4. Platform Onboarding 5. Training & Test Flight 6.

Further, benefits, retirement and compensation information are shared with and incorporated into the workflow of our planners so that they can answer questions and promote all of the outstanding existing benefits available to our clients' employees.

As a newer company, we are uniquely positioned with agility to meet the evolving needs of both families and employers. We are not anchored by legacy mindsets, policies, or financial modeling. We believe that the status quo is no longer sufficient for the demands on working parents. Instead, we approach every situation with a growth mindset, always seeking opportunities for improvement and advancement.

Vivvi provides all three by operating on a credit system for employees to access care and learning for their families.  The Vivvi Credit System affords employers maximum flexibility to determine subsidy amounts across all offerings.

We also create a custom landing page for each employer where employees can learn more about what we do and get started.   Operational Implementation: You will work with Neura's Director of Operations and support team to define Standard Operating Procedures for pre and post activation logistics.

CuraLinc’s model fills care delivery and UX (user experience) gaps that plague traditional EAP providers. An excellent example of this is the approach to connecting participants to care. While most EAP vendors send a list of providers to employees seeking care – and force them to call each one until they find a provider who is willing to accept new patients – CuraLinc’s concierge approach only maps participants to providers with confirmed availability. CuraLinc even offers to schedule the first appointment.  • Navigation.  CuraLinc’s licensed clinicians provide personalized guidance to the ideal level of care, modality or discipline, whether it’s within the EAP or another employer-sponsored program. • Personalized Access.  CuraLinc offers twelve different ways for employees to access treatment and support, including text therapy and digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT). All modalities were built in-house, too, which eliminates problems associated with using third parties to deliver key clinical elements of a program.  • Immediate Support.  Every call into the program is answered by an independently licensed mental health clinician around-the-clock, 365 days a year. These clinicians are empowered to provide immediate care and support to employees with urgent mental health needs.  • Alignment with DEI and Health Equity Objectives.  CuraLinc’s culturally competent clinical and organizational services meet the needs of today’s diverse workforce. In addition, the program's approach to addressing social determinants of health (SDoH) minimizes healthcare inequities based on socioeconomic and community factors. • Speed to Care.  Participants can schedule ongoing support with counselors and coaches in as little as 24 hours (same day for emergency situations), either telephonically or through the program’s digital platform. The average speed to a first appointment is just 2.1 days.  • Psychiatry Support.  Participants who need medication or advanced treatment benefit from personalized advocacy and guidance to resources within their benefit plan or within the community, enhancing speed to care and quality. • Quality.  Evidence-based treatment is delivered by providers based on six distinct dimensions of quality, including satisfaction, Net Promoter Score, availability, case resolution and outcomes.  • Measurable Impact.  CuraLinc’s evidence-based approach leads to a measurable impact on employee health and productivity. CuraLinc uses a combination of clinically validated tools both for care planning and for measuring the effectiveness of the EAP on depression, anxiety, productivity, alcohol abuse and absenteeism.  • Support for Teens and Adolescents.  CuraLinc provides specialized resources and tools to improve teen and adolescent emotional fitness. • Flexibility and Customization.  Every element of the plan will be tailored to suit each client, from the technology suite to the promotional materials to the method by which the intake line is answered.  • Thought Partnership.  CuraLinc takes a collaborative and proactive approach to client service and thought partnership, including ownership, corrective action planning and thorough communication in the event of a problem or crisis.  • Innovation.  CuraLinc has an organizational commitment to developing services and features that extend the footprint of care and deliver mental health support in a meaningful manner to every participant.

Our average first response time is under 15 minutes, ensuring that our clients receive timely support when they need it the most.  Efficient Resolution: Our effectiveness in addressing client issues is demonstrated by our ability to resolve 96% of all support tickets within the first hour. This efficiency minimizes disruptions and ensures that our clients can maintain their operational tempo without unnecessary delays.  Round-the-Clock Support: Recognizing that healthcare doesn't adhere to a 9-to-5 schedule, we've developed a 24/7 knowledge center. This allows our clients to access vital information and support at any hour, ensuring they have the resources they need to make informed decisions and address issues promptly.  Personalized Support: To further tailor our support, we provide dedicated client support staff to each account, ensuring that our clients have a go-to expert familiar with their specific needs and history. For larger clients, we also offer an executive sponsor, creating a direct line to our senior leadership for strategic guidance and support.  Our approach to customer service is more than just solving problems; it's about providing a seamless, supportive experience that empowers our clients to achieve their goals.

Our clients are welcome to consult their own benefits lawyers on this issue, and we can't offer legal advice to them about COBRA.",,1,"PCORI: The way this requirement applies to them differs depending on whether the client has a self-funded or fully-insured major medical health plan:  Fully Insured: Employer will be subject to PCORI fees for the Garner HRA. Normally, when an employer only has a fully-insured major medical health plan, the insurer (e.g., Aetna, United, Cigna, etc.) pays the PCORI fees, and the employer doesn't have to worry about them. But the Garner HRA is technically a tiny self-funded group health plan, so the employer owes PCORI fees just for having Garner. (This is true even if the Garner HRA is layered on top of a fully-insured major medical health plan.) Third party administrators like us are not allowed to pay the fee on behalf of the client.  ASO: Having the HRA doesn't require employers to pay anything extra for PCORI. So those clients shouldn't need to do anything special to satisfy the PCORI requirement just because they have the Garner HRA. SPDs: Garner provides template SPD language for client review.

While other vendors have had to focus a large portion of their development budgets into assimilating various technologies resulting from mergers and acquisitions, Crossover has been able to dedicate resources solely to increasing value for our customers over the last 13+ years. Several areas where Crossover distinguishes itself are outlined further below.  1) Simplifying the patient-provider relationship: We believe our greatest innovation related to patient care is that we have made it easy to receive care and restored faith in the patient-provider relationship. At Crossover, it is easy to schedule an appointment with your provider, easy to message, easy to check in, and easy to pay. There is no wait. It is easy to receive acute care, get referred to specialists, and maintain your health record across providers. It is easy to build a relationship with your provider and follow through with a recovery plan. All of the investments we have made in care delivery make it easier for employees to return to a state of wellbeing quickly and increase satisfaction because they know that every Crossover provider has their best interest in mind. For us, the simplicity of building great relationships with our clients' employees is the greatest innovation!  2) Primary Health as a platform: We believe in the power of our “Connected System of Health” to guide members through an entire episode of care, as an injury or illness can have an enormous impact on a company's medical spend due to the need for follow-up care or condition management. We believe our Connected System of Health brings a superior patient experience, enhanced clinical efficiency and quality, and provides the member with a concierge-esque experience that is managed with efficiency and cost control in mind.  3) One size does not fit all: We are not an off-the-shelf solution. Crossover is focused on operational excellence and has a number of proven, scaled systems and practices to ensure we are maximizing budgets and client-specific goals. However, we deploy an adaptable approach to engage a range of populations across all 50 states. We are honored to work with our clients every step of the way to increase benefit awareness and utilization. We thrive in partnering with health activist employers to continue creating innovative solutions and tailoring ideas and results for their unique employee subsets at every stage in their company's growth. Our flexibility to respond, create, and adapt for employers has become increasingly important as care teams become a critical part of addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) within a population through their trusted relationships with the members.   To note, Crossover's differentiators have afforded us the following outcomes: 98% client retention, 90 NPS, and 81% of users have named us their medical home. ",2,"Crossover does not have any headcount minimums, but we do have a $350,000 minimum for Nearsite and Virtual care offerings. We also offer virtual urgent care only beginning at $200,000.","Crossover uses the following financial models: PEPM, Cost+, PUPM, and fixed fee.",,,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,"Our standard access hours are as follows: • Weekdays: 8am-5pm local time via platform, phone + video • Weekends: 8am-5pm local time via platform, phone + video   Crossover alos offers after-hours urgent care by phone. Members are reassured that their after-hours care is provided by on-call Crossover providers who can begin and document an urgent care plan that the member's main care team can easily continue during normal operating hours. On-call coverage may be limited to certain hours. Members also have Crossover Platform access 24/7 and can message providers at any time for follow-up during office hours.","Crossover takes a team-based approach to Account Management to ensure an exceptional level of customer service along with strategic discussions based on data. Clinical governance is also a key component of ensuring quality care is delivered and metrics are attained.  Crossover's Account Management team includes an Account Principal, Associate Account Principal, and Client Success Manager. The Account Principal is responsible for development of the client strategy and serves as an expert on Crossover best practices. The Account Principal will also serve as backup to the Associate Account Principal should they be out of the office on PTO or because of illness, etc. The Associate Account Principal serves as the client's direct point of contact and handles day-to-day initiatives/reporting on key performance indicators, etc. The Client Success Manager is responsible for driving engagement associated with the client's health center to include planning events, implementing campaigns, and deploying surveys to identify barriers in care. Every client has a designated (occasionally dedicated, depending on the partnership model) account team.   Crossover's clinical team takes a similar approach to supporting our clients as well as onsite health center services. Our Medical Directors along with Practice Managers work together to provide the clinical oversight and governance as well as provide additional clinical expertise for client-related questions.  In summary, the Crossover Account Management and Medical Group work together to ensure Crossover is achieving the ""Quadruple Aim:” 1) highest quality of care, 2) decreased spend, 3) superior patient experience, and 4) strong employee/provider engagement.","Behavioral Health Specialist • Licensed MFT with current state license (must be active on date offer letter is signed and on first date of work).  • Proficient in evidence-based treatments (i.e. CBT, ACT and DBT). • Must have attended an APA-accredited program. • Minimum 5 years related clinical experience serving patients across the mental health, family relationships, addiction and recovery, and work related spectrum. • Current BLS (Basic Life Support) certification.

We have an internally developed methodology that is designed to ensure successful launches with a minimal time commitment from our clients. We leverage project plans that are organized by workstreams, with clearly defined milestones to keep focus on our deliverables and timeline. To date we have launched 47 health centers in 11 different states, and with our 4 virtual care teams we are providing access to healthcare for our members in all 50 states. All implementations are workstream-based, timeline-focused, and design-oriented.   Our approach to implementations is based on The Waterfall Method - with our project requirements and activities organized by workstreams. We start with Procurement, where we leverage our contracts, in addition to information gathered from our implementation discovery work, to create our project plan. The additional workstreams build off one another and flow from Eligibility & Services, to Benefits, Staffing, Facilities, Technology, Engagement, which includes member communications, and ultimately Operations. We use the Operations Workstream to ensure that the full scope of our implementation is accounted for, planned for, and completed leading up to our launch date. Project milestones are scheduled based on the implementation discovery work as well as project requirements, and work is tracked via detailed implementation checklists throughout the course of the project.   One of the project management techniques that we apply to our implementations is the critical path method - where we identify the tasks that are necessary for project completion - and then work through their dependencies and time requirements. This helps us identify and mitigate risks, in support of keeping our schedule on track. There are typically eight critical paths that come into play with our implementations, including the minimum lead time required to complete each item, and the corresponding dependencies.  ",F_RhsIpjGwFGdQ4Gl,Attachment C - Anonymized Crossover Welcome Packet.pdf,1719408,application/pdf,1,"Our standard request is 180 days to provide adequate time to transition patients to another provider and, if applicable, health center management to a successor vendor. ","The role of Crossover's Client Success Manager (CSM) and our in-house Client Marketing (Engagement) Team is to drive ongoing engagement by bringing awareness of health center services and wellness initiatives to a client's eligible employee and dependent population. Crossover seeks to partner with the employers to deploy a strategy based on what they have built to date, identifying best practices for communication and engagement.  In addition, Crossover can serve as a ""force multiplier"" of our customers' benefits ecosystem to coordinate and facilitate wellness programs and incentives. A recent example is a client's wellness coordinator had identified specific dates to hold mobile mammogram testing events. Our CSM was informed in advance and began actively promoting the event through her channels as well as through the health center to encourage strong attendance.   Typical launch communications for eligibles can include: • Virtual launch event • Launch toolkit: Potential for co-branding across creative assets and copy • Activation emails: Sent to all eligibles (details to be agreed upon in client plan) • Direct mail: To reach eligibles and dependents at home • Digital advertisements: Awareness ads across social media and selective/non-invasive retargeting ads • Additional collateral: Benefits flier provided in printable PDF form and on-campus signage • Support services: Access to Crossover support webpage, educational content, and live-chat and phone support  Crossover includes a full slate of ongoing communications for members post-opening in our pricing, such as:   • Welcome email: Co-branded design, automatically sent upon members completing their activation • Monthly member emails: Clinician-led content based on important health issues and highlighting specific services as appropriate • Invitations to live webinars: Hosted by Crossover providers discussing important health issues and resources available through Crossover • Automated, targeted emails by behavior (e.g., newly eligible, activated but not yet received care, etc.) • Care platform communications: To engage members 1:1 and deliver appointment reminders, personalized follow-up messages during and after care, post-care surveys, and relevant information on new services • Appointment confirmations and reminders • Post-care user surveys and referral emails • Survey and referral thank you mailings ",F_uvHCmT6wM9u8yuR,Attachment D - Crossover Health Brand Guidelines.pdf,29340730,application/pdf,"Research has shown that a diverse and representative health care workforce improves patients’ access to care, their perceptions of the care they receive, and their health outcomes. Studies also show measurable gains in access, quality, and health outcomes when patients’ health care teams mirror their personal characteristics, and that it can reduce medical bias and increase identification of diseases and conditions which are more likely to affect only a certain sub-population. Accordingly, Crossover prioritizes diversity in hiring.   With regard to outward-facing initiatives for diverse populations, we have clinical programs that can be tailored to the needs of specific segments. For example, we provide training and education on transgender care issues so that our providers are skilled at addressing the needs of this community. We also promote population-specific interventions, such as Hepatitis B screenings amongst those who were born in Asia or who have parents born in Asia.   Our environment encourages and enforces the following ""operating behaviors:"" respectful communication and cooperation between all employees, teamwork and employee participation, permitting the representation of all groups and employee perspectives, and employer and employee contributions to the communities we serve—all in order to promote a greater understanding of, and respect for, diversity.  We not only celebrate our diverse workforce at Crossover, we also embrace inclusivity and belonging through representation and action. Each year, employees across all teams have the opportunity to serve on the Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (DIB) team. The DIB team curates speakers to help facilitate open BIPOC dialog, sponsors group challenges to share unique ethnic and LGBTQ+ experiences, and provides scholarships and awards for employees who exemplify the core mission of DIB.",1,,Please refer to Attachment E - Crossover Eligibility File Specifications for the requested information,F_2Eb3N9o3Jy3w9kA,Attachment E - Crossover Eligibility File Specifications.xlsx,11926,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet,1,1,1,1,"Crossover can integrate with many systems and supports single sign on (SSO) capabilities.

While many solutions address ~30 simple conditions, we offer a full range of Primary Care services, inclusive of preventive care and screenings, diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic conditions, and addressing social determinants of health (SDOH). Our integrated care teams can manage acute and chronic illness, routine check-ups, sick visits, prescriptions, and more.  Mental Health: Crossover's approach to Behavioral/Mental Health consists of evidence-based care that is goal-focused, measurement-based, focused on member empowerment and independence, and delivered in a culturally competent manner with an ongoing emphasis on reducing stigma attached to mental health struggles and treatment. Our Mental Health providers (psychologists, therapists, and social workers) are qualified to diagnose and treat a wide range of conditions and disorders that affect emotional wellbeing, including work-related stress and anxiety, personal and professional relationship issues, couples' counseling, sleep issues, depression and anxiety, trauma, and medication management.   Physical Medicine: Crossover's comprehensive Physical Medicine program offers industry-leading treatment efficiency and effectiveness benchmarking. Our physical therapy evaluation embodies all aspects of sound musculoskeletal care: in-depth history-taking, exploration for the cause of the member's symptoms, and customized treatments based on a thorough and thoughtful exam. Risk stratification tools, like the STarT Back Tool, help our therapists identify members who might benefit from immediate telehealth services (such as exercise instruction) and/or on-demand educational resources (such as those from our Be Well program) that do not require in-person visits.  Health Coaching: Crossover Health Coaches know that staying committed to a healthy lifestyle is not always easy. Experts in motivation, the coaches will learn what drives an individual and the behaviors that can shape (or challenge) their progress. They will help set realistic goals and inspire the member to stay on track as they work together—at the member's own pace and via unlimited coaching sessions—to reach them.  Occupational Medicine: Under the direction of our Director of Occupational Medicine, who is board certified in Occupational Medicine and has 10 years of experience, Crossover is expanding our scope to include a full complement of services for the prevention, screening, and treatment of work-related injuries and illnesses.   Pediatrics: Crossover’s virtual Pediatrics offering, provided by our partner Blueberry Pediatrics, supports unlimited pediatric urgent care services 24/7 (including holidays) via asynchronous messaging or synchronous virtual visits. Blueberry Pediatrics can provide services to most states and continues to expand their national footprint.  Navigation: Crossover’s Navigation services incorporate Member Support, Referral Management, and Benefits Advocacy. In short, Member Support helps navigate members within Crossover (e.g., answering questions about Crossover services); Referral Management helps navigate members to care and services outside of Crossover (e.g., referrals to in-network, lowest cost, highest quality specialists); and Benefits Advocacy helps address other member issue sets (e.g., questions on insurance, coverage and bills, and other employer-provided benefits).

Our instruction methods include lecture, hands-on learning, game-based learning, peer-to-peer teaching, on-the-job observation, and reverse observation. Consultants are assessed at the end of training with a written test and call scoring. Upon completion, consultants spend an additional 80 hours of on-the-job training for iterative skill development, with dedicated peer assistance.

SSO and Email/Password: Alternatively, employers can choose to allow employees to sign in using either SSO or traditional email and password. This option offers additional flexibility, accommodating diverse user preferences and scenarios. Enhanced Security: By using Auth0, Tuned leverages advanced security features such as multifactor authentication (MFA), anomaly detection, and breach detection. These features help protect against unauthorized access and ensure that user credentials are secure. User Experience: Our SSO implementation is designed to enhance the user experience by reducing password fatigue and login friction. Employees can seamlessly access Tuned services with their existing corporate credentials, eliminating the need to remember multiple passwords.

Firstly, at the company level, we maintain a dedicated customer success team comprising implementation managers, account managers, and SLAs . We go beyond mere service provision; we tie our fees to the satisfaction of our employer benefits teams. This ensures that our support not only meets but exceeds expectations, aligning our success with the satisfaction of those we serve.  Secondly, at the member level, we prioritize creating a supportive and outstanding experience. We extend our support beyond traditional hours, offering customer support and clinical visits during nights and weekends. Our SLAs ensure that 95% of messages are responded to within one day, with first appointment wait times kept under seven days. Moreover, we hold ourselves accountable by putting fees at risk for these metrics alongside member satisfaction. By embedding these practices into our service ethos, we guarantee that each member receives the attention, care, and responsiveness they deserve throughout their journey with Ilant ","Care team is onshore and employed (W2) with experience across obesity treatment modalities:  Obesity Medicine Physicians: board-certified in Obesity Medline, active medical license and DEA, experience with range of medications & bariatric patients and using protocols & care pathways  Dietitian (Nutrition): active registered dietitian license, obesity medicine and bariatric experience  Mental Health Specialist: licensed Therapist: PhD, PsyD, LCSW, LPC, LMFT, experience with behavioral modalities, eating disorders, and compulsive behaviors  Peer Navigators: lived obesity & obesity treatment experience, healthcare-related professional experience preferred  Nurses: active RN license, obesity medicine & bariatric experience  Care team must complete Ilant training (~2-3 days) and assessments before seeing any member. Ongoing oversight and learning through weekly case reviews, ongoing training, and regular audits. ",1,,,,,,,1,+75,2,"Purpose-built to work with employers, we have invested in backend integrations to simplify implementation and have a structured process in-place to support robust transitions.  Each client has an assigned Implementation Manager (and Account Manager) that is responsible for delivering a successful implementation..  Implementation is conducted across three core workstreams:  1) Benefit Elections and Setup (completion expected 30-60 days after Kickoff): Initial efforts focus on finalizing benefit selections, including eligibility criteria for the Ilant Health program, executing the Master Services Agreement, and determining the billing method for rendered services (claims or direct billing) as well as member cost-sharing and any program incentives.  As part of this work, we confirm our ability to process eligibility via our Availity back-end integration.  2) Health and Wellness Benefit Coordination (completion expected 60-90 days after Kickoff): Starting two weeks after the kickoff, this phase involves integrating with relevant client Health and Wellness Benefit Suppliers of the employer. Key milestones for this workstream include: identifying Ilant Health providers with the PBM to enable seamless approval for anti-obesity medications (i.e. modifying PBM prior auth/stop), working with health plans/centers of excellence to understand existing networks and policies for lab orders (facilitated for Labcorp and Quest via our integrations) and bariatric surgery, coordinating with onsite clinics (where available), developing and distributing communication materials across health plan, PBM, and relevant vendors, and setting up warm transfer and coordination protocols across all benefit vendors (e.g., to mental health, from health plan care management, etc.)  3) Communication Strategy (completion 60-90 days after Kickoff):  Recognizing that employer will lead all the communication efforts, our goal is to provide materials that enable clear, non-judgemental information that aligns with the employer’s values and culture.  We provided recommended communication timelines and cadence as well as materials which are modified to use language that will resonate in the client environment (for example, we found for our tech/tech-adjacent clients ""obesity treatment"" and ""metabolic health and wellness"" resonated while for a manufacturing client we are currently rolling out, that was confusing and ""weight loss"" was better language.)  An important element of our communication strategy is to provide materials to proactively engage those in obesity treatment (e.g., on obesity medications) today as they may have more questions on a transition (and logistically need to ensure continuity of care).  The communication strategy is established early (by day 30-45) and launched prior to going live. ",,,,,1,Generally we would allow for termination on an annual renewal with a 90 day notice.,"For initial outreach, we find a multi-channel approach (e.g., email, mailer/postcard, benefits site, live webinar sessions, on-site signage) works best. Style of communication is critical - our messaging is non-judgemental and focuses on suggesting engagement to learn more (versus to start prescribed solution). Ability to use personal email and engaging through individuals with lived experience is helpful to reduce hesitancy (from concerns of being identified or judged).   A differentiator of our program is sustained engagement through concierge peer navigators. Borrowing from mental health and addiction, leveraging peer support with lived obesity experience increases trust between members and our program. Our peer navigators meet monthly with members via synchronous video visits, and proactively outreach via phone, text, email to members in between visits with reminders, encouragement, and educational support. ",F_0SXH4t5LifaxgeR,Promotion & Communications.pdf,811372,application/pdf,"We support DEI in several ways: Our treatment recommendations take into account who our members are and their Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) (e.g., are they able to regularly eat food with medications, can they manage nausea while on their job, etc.)  Our approach to nutrition and movement is culturally competent and socio-economically sensitive. We recognize some members may eat largely from fast food/cafeterias, may buy groceries at dollar stores, or may need to make meals palpable for the whole family. We focus on enabling better choices within the context of a member’s life, not prescribing specific requirements.  Our peer navigators are matched by affinity, and our overall care team is as diverse as the members we serve, with 45% of our care team identifying as white, 36% black, 9% hispanic, and 9% asian.  We are also proud to share that many members of our leadership team and care team have lived obesity experience and many are from diverse groups (women, LGBTQIA+).
