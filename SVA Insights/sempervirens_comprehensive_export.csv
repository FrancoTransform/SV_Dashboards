Hadley,https://www.gohadley.com/,2020,"Hadley enables employers to offer 529 savings benefits. 529 savings are lifelong savings accounts for both adults and children, and funds grow tax-free for costs related to education K-12 through graduate school; technical and trade school; student loans; retirement; disability costs; apprenticeships; professional certifications and career credentials; and more.","We help employers offer 529 benefits with our turnkey solution.

Like 401k, 529 is on the federal tax code.
Unlike 401k, 529 Plans are governed state-by-state, creating a ton of complexity for employers - until Hadley.

Because there are 150+ 529 Plans, it's been nearly impossible for PEOs and enterprises to offer 529 payroll benefits to employees. Some employees already have 529's set up, often through their advisors, and most employees don't even know about 529's. 

Hadley solves the problem around offering 529 benefits. Employees link existing accounts, or use Hadley to find and open their best account. Then, payroll connects to every 529 Plan any employee can have. Employees then use the Hadley app to connect and save more with colleagues, family, friends, and neighbors - think Venmo for 529's. Hadley is the only 529 benefits solution that has universal 529 payment rails and a personalized platform that routes users to their best plan.

Our solution is turnkey. Hadley auto-syncs with payroll, making it easy to administer with no manual entry or file feeds.

Why now? 529's got a massive revamp under the new Trump tax bill for both adults and children, making it an even richer benefit and critical for Americans. 529's cover: education K-12 through grad school; student loans; retirement; disability costs; professional and career credentials and certifications; and more. 

Plus, employers now can also earn corporate tax credits for offering 529 benefits. Also, employees in most states can deduct their 529 contributions from income taxes, creating immediate savings.  

We educate employees throughout the year, and it's important because nationally America has $2T in student debt with 7 in 10 Americans unaware of 529's. Plus, funds transfer tax-free among family and even future descendants, making 529's critical intergenerational wealth builders every American should have.",https://docsend.com/view/ngjwsfd4rg7jf64g,https://youtu.be/92wMVLDt3_Y,4,4,4,"The founding team demonstrates strong execution ability and domain expertise.

Petunia (Petunia Technologies LLC),https://www.usepetunia.com,2024,"Petunia is a Wellness Benefit that helps busy families (GenX & Millennials) discover & decide on Senior Living for their Aging Loved Ones. Petunia provides unbiased tools, structure and guidance to help you make a life-changing decision for a Loved One, confidently.","When aging in place is not an option or not preferred, choosing where your aging Loved One will live becomes a stressful, high-stakes decision, yet 200,000 families a year face this decision with almost no guidance. Across the 11MM Sandwich Generation employees in the workforce, and with more Baby Boomers turning 80 daily, this problem is accelerating rapidly.

For Families: Today, families have 3 paths to navigate the Assisted Living or Memory Care decision - one they’re making for their Loved One with their Loved One’s money:
(1) Referral sites and ""consultants"" who get paid $5-10,000 only when your Loved One moves in. When advisors are incentivized to place your Loved One with a Community where they have a referral fee agreement, are they really working for you?
(2) Online directories that function like paid advertising platforms; communities pay to boost their listings, so what you see isn't necessarily what's best for your family.
(3) Google, spreadsheets, and hope - families struggle through 70+ hours of research, tours, and coordination with zero structure or guidance, leading to confusion, frustration, and doubt about such a critical decision.

For Employers: This decision process takes a toll on your workforce. Nearly 2 full work weeks are lost per affected employee as they navigate community tours, appointments, and assessments - all occurring during business hours. Your most valuable mid-career and senior employees (GenX & Millennials) are already stretched thin with Sandwich Generation responsibilities and now face this significant emotional and practical strain. As the largest generation in history ages, a significant portion of your workforce will face this decision in the coming years, making the productivity and retention impact massive.

Further the data is siloed and stored with the respective service provider.

Survivors face ongoing challenges, with 74% experiencing physical and psychosocial side effects such as pain, fatigue, and distress. As survival rates climb, the demand for long-term care to manage side effects and prevent recurrence is outpacing the growth in supply. Healthcare has been slow to adapt. Survivorship programs, proven to improve outcomes and reduce recurrence, are absent in most hospitals due to a lack of staff, limited expertise, insufficient infrastructure, and difficulty tracking patient outcomes. This leaves survivors navigating recovery alone, leading to worse health outcomes and higher costs across the system. This challenge will only intensify. Cancer incidence is rising, in particular for younger generations, creating a growing population at high risk for late effects of treatment and potential cancer recurrence.

iCommute,https://www.icommute.app/,2022,iCommute is an AI-native shared mobility platform serving universities and corporate campuses.,"Daily campus and workplace commutes are broken:

Time wasted – Students and employees lose ≈2 hours a day on unreliable transit or traffic.

High costs – Parking passes, fuel, and rideshares can exceed $300/month—often unaffordable for cash-strapped students or low-income staff.

Environmental mandates – 75 % of cars arriving on North-American campuses carry one occupant, inflating parking demand and Scope-3 CO₂ emissions that institutions must now report under new IFRS S2/SEC rules.

Why it matters: Universities and employers face a triple squeeze: limited land for new $5 k–$15 k parking stalls, rising sustainability targets, and retention challenges as commuters push back against return-to-office mandates. Students and staff feel the pinch in lost time, tight budgets, and climate anxiety.

Consider a student who fractures their leg during an intramural game—no matter how comprehensive a university’s health center is, that student will likely need hospital care. If the student lacks adequate insurance, the situation becomes a major headache for the student and university, leading to potential reputational damage, legal liability from parents, retention risks due to medical debt, and even financial liability for hospitals covering uninsured students. Since the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the majority of students—up to 90% in some cases—are covered under their parents’ insurance.

Portfolios are fragmented with poor visibility and control. Merchants/issuers burn margins on generic points with weak retention/differentiation.

Clinical trial monitoring today is highly manual, causing delays in detecting issues, increasing risks to patient safety, and trial integrity. Complex trials and CRA shortages add to inefficiencies, while manual monitoring drives 25–30% of total trial costs, placing significant financial burden on the $60B+ global clinical trial market. Manual EDC data entry is a massive time and cost burden—taking up to 15 hr/week per coordinator and causing 8-day delays between patient visits and data availability. This lag slows down query resolution, increases risk, adds up to $30,000 per patient in transcription costs, and pulls site staff away from patient care.",https://1drv.ms/b/c/f9a361bfc63d7b4d/ESf9g8Ks8htJnA7OIPmpHEIB9oZ_svpsNIOjZ2zXsRtoeQ,https://1drv.ms/b/c/f9a361bfc63d7b4d/ESf9g8Ks8htJnA7OIPmpHEIB9oZ_svpsNIOjZ2zXsRtoeQ,3,4,2,"The founding team has complementary skills with domain expertise in clinical trials and technical expertise in AI/ML.
