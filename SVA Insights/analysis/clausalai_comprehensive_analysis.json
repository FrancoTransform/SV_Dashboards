  "description": "We\u2019re building a real-time payment integrity platform that plugs into any TPA/self-funded health plan to stop the up to 10% of spend that\u2019s typically paid in error. Our LLM native stack provides the deep claims analysis of an expert auditing team at a fraction of the time and cost.",
  "problem_statement": "Employee healthcare spending is the #2 expense for employers behind payroll and it is growing faster than wages to levels that are becoming unsustainable. CMS Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) program estimates that roughly 10% of Medicare and Medicaid spending is typically paid in error. Extrapolating this finding across the self-insured employer market that spends $1 Trillion annually in the US, around $100 billion is likely paid in error. In specific circumstances, such as noted in the Grainger (a self-insured employer) vs. Aetna lawsuit, up to 44% of improper plan payments have been discovered. The scale of the problem is massive. In addition, under the provisions of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (enforced as of 2024) there is increased scrutiny and possible legal action against self-insured employers that don't prudently spend their health plan dollars (similar to 401k). This creates a previously unseen urgency around the problem.",
