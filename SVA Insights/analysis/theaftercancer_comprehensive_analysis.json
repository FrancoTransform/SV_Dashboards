  "description": "The After Cancer enables organizations to launch scalable, virtual survivorship programs by merging their clinical expertise with our technology. We deliver personalized care plans addressing patients\u2019 side effects, mental health, and recurrence risk, while aligning oncology stakeholders to improve patient outcomes and lower costs through real-world data.",
  "problem_statement": "As a society, we invested heavily in better cancer treatments and earlier diagnoses and we\u2019re now seeing the results: over 18 million cancer survivors in the US. Survivors face ongoing challenges, with 74% experiencing physical and psychosocial side effects such as pain, fatigue, and distress. As survival rates climb, the demand for long-term care to manage side effects and prevent recurrence is outpacing the growth in supply. Healthcare has been slow to adapt. Survivorship programs, proven to improve outcomes and reduce recurrence, are absent in most hospitals due to a lack of staff, limited expertise, insufficient infrastructure, and difficulty tracking patient outcomes. This leaves survivors navigating recovery alone, leading to worse health outcomes and higher costs across the system. This challenge will only intensify. Cancer incidence is rising, in particular for younger generations, creating a growing population at high risk for late effects of treatment and potential cancer recurrence. Without adequate long-term support, these patients are likely to reenter the healthcare system in costly and preventable ways, affecting every stakeholder in oncology from patients and providers to payers.",
