  "description": "AI tool automating clinical trials",
  "problem_statement": "I'm specifically referring to two critical inefficiencies in clinical trials today: manual monitoring and manual EDC data entry. Clinical trial monitoring today is highly manual, causing delays in detecting issues, increasing risks to patient safety, and trial integrity. Complex trials and CRA shortages add to inefficiencies, while manual monitoring drives 25\u201330% of total trial costs, placing significant financial burden on the $60B+ global clinical trial market. Manual EDC data entry is a massive time and cost burden\u2014taking up to 15 hr/week per coordinator and causing 8-day delays between patient visits and data availability. This lag slows down query resolution, increases risk, adds up to $30,000 per patient in transcription costs, and pulls site staff away from patient care.",
