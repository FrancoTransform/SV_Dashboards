  "description": "Zo\u2019rier is a streetwear brand built on collaboration as the core growth engine, creating culturally-driven drops in partnership with local creatives and established voices. We merge storytelling, design, and community engagement into wearable statements, building a scalable model where every release expands both reach and cultural relevance.",
  "problem_statement": "Currently, customers are turning to a mix of niche streetwear brands, fast fashion retailers, and large department stores to satisfy their style needs often based on trend, price, or identity. At Zo\u2019rier Co., we recognize that self-expression is not one-dimensional; so we offer a universal brand that bridges bold statement pieces, everyday wear, and diverse aesthetics, allowing customers to fully show up as themselves in one place.",
