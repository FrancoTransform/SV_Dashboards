  "description": "Newlane University is an accredited institution delivering affordable, flexible, technology-powered degrees to underserved learners. Our self-paced, competency-based learning process is a revolution - it lets students move as fast or as slow as they need - and the best part is it brings the cost of a bachelor\u2019s degree down to $3,000.",
  "problem_statement": "More than half of U.S. college students leave school without a degree, creating 42M people with \u201csome college\u201d but no credential. The main cause is the rigid, outdated structure - 15-week semesters, required attendance, and process over outcomes. Newlane solves this with modern solutions like self-paced and competency-based learning, and is the means to unlock an incredible amount of human potential.",
