  "problem_statement": "- Our flagship service addresses a critical compliance requirement for universities. Educational institutions mandate health insurance coverage for their student populations—sometimes due to state regulations (e.g., Massachusetts) and invariably as a risk mitigation, reputation protecting measure. Consider a student who fractures their leg during an intramural game—no matter how comprehensive a university’s health center is, that student will likely need hospital care. If the student lacks adequate insurance, the situation becomes a major headache for the student and university, leading to potential reputational damage, legal liability from parents, retention risks due to medical debt, and even financial liability for hospitals covering uninsured students. Since the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the majority of students—up to 90% in some cases—are covered under their parents’ insurance. Thus, these students can waive out of the university-sponsored health insurance plan (SHIP), but the waiver process is complex. Schools impose specific requirements such as deductible limits, HMO vs. PPO preferences, and restrictions on out-of-state plans, making verification of an entire student body a logistical nightmare.",
