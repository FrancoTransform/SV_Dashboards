  "description": "Care Hero is an AI-powered marketplace connecting healthcare organizations with certified caregivers for insurance-covered senior home care. Our platform reduces caregiver onboarding from weeks to 48 hours. We've secured contracts serving thousands of families across Massachusetts, Florida, and Texas.",
  "problem_statement": "America faces an unprecedented eldercare crisis as 73 million baby boomers reach 65 by 2030, with 88% preferring to age at home rather than in costly institutional settings. However, the home care system is fundamentally broken across multiple dimensions. Healthcare organizations struggle to find reliable, certified caregivers due to severe fragmentation\u201480% of providers are small mom-and-pop agencies with an unsustainable 80% annual turnover rate. This creates cascading failures where families face $75,000 annual out-of-pocket costs, frequent last-minute cancellations, and inconsistent quality of care that forces loved ones into expensive nursing facilities. The problem matters now because demographic trends are accelerating faster than the system can adapt. Health plans desperately need consistent, scalable home care partners to manage costs and improve outcomes, but the current fragmented landscape makes this nearly impossible. Meanwhile, 5.2 million direct caregivers seek better opportunities but lack connection to insurance-covered work that could provide stable income and career growth. Without intervention, millions of seniors will be forced into institutional care they don't want, at costs healthcare systems cannot sustain, while qualified caregivers remain underemployed and underpaid.",
