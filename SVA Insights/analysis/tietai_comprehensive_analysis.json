  "description": "Tiet.ai provides AI-powered healthcare data integration for the European Health Data Space era. Our platform transforms fragmented health data into FHIR-compliant, interoperable formats in weeks, not years. Led by team with algorithm development and medical device regulatory expertise, enabling hospitals to achieve EHDS compliance.",
  "problem_statement": "European healthcare generates massive data daily, yet citizens can't easily access their health records electronically, and researchers struggle to use this data for improved treatments. With 27 EU countries using incompatible healthcare systems and the EHDS compliance deadline of March 2027, healthcare organizations urgently need AI-powered data integration that ensures regulatory compliance while enabling interoperability. This matters because fragmented data prevents better patient outcomes, slows medical research, and hinders evidence-based healthcare policy.",
