  "problem_statement": "$3T locked in vehicles, an underutilized asset. 40M people in the US regularly use predatory lending products - like payday, title lending, and pawn shops - while charged over 300% APR. More people are stuck in debt and with a lower credit score than ever.\n\nHaving a trusted financial partner and lowering borrowing costs for millions of Americans will improve prosperity and quality of life. Many will avoid the debt cycle - currently the norm for this segment.",
