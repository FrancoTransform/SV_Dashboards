    "When we started Ezra we weren't sure what would resonate more: the easiest way to financially secure your workforce or the easiest way to reduce turnover in real-time. Anthony Valletta, CEO of Bartaco, sits on our advisory board. He told us it was the latter. So we focused on large QSRs given high turnover rates within the industry, highlighted our SOC2 compliant software, and messages our solution as way for managers to keep their teams motivated, productive, and engaged. Within 3 months of implementing the feedback, McDonald's and Shake Shack came through on inbound with projected close by Q3'25."
