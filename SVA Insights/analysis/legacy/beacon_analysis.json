  "description": "Beacon is building the data layer to underwrite hiring. We start by identifying, verifying, and matching top specialty recruiters with employers using AI\u2014fixing the broken front door to talent acquisition. This unlocks recruiter-led sourcing, referrals, and productivity\u2014and sets the stage for a future where hiring is fully data-backed and risk-mitigated.",
  "problem_statement": "Hiring today is unverified guesswork, and it\u2019s costing companies billions. Recruiters\u2014often the first and most important decision in a search\u2014are chosen by gut, not data.\n\nBeacon changes that. We\u2019re building the infrastructure to underwrite hiring by verifying and matching specialty recruiters using AI. This improves sourcing, referral quality, and recruiter productivity\u2014but more importantly, it lays the foundation for de-risked, data-driven hiring.\n\nIn a $200B+ industry where bad decisions lead to $1B+ annually of costly recruiter misfires, Beacon makes recruiter selection the strategic lever for better outcomes.",

Their biggest pain point is winning the next job order: being discoverable to buyers who need them but don\u2019t know they exist. Operational inefficiencies that erode BD time are a secondary pain point.\nMarket size: The U.S. Direct Hire market is $13B (SIA).

    "While serving as CFO during two exits (1010data, Flashpoint), I saw firsthand how even elite firms mishandled critical executive searches\u2014wasting $1M+ across multiple roles. Specialty recruiters often outperformed, but lacked visibility. The tipping point: a $100k non-refundable retainer lost to a \u201ctop firm,\u201d while a specialty recruiter earned a $150k fee with one lead. This experience drove me to pivot from CFO to founder\u2014to build the platform I wish we\u2019d had."
