We made this a high priority early after seeing this. We heard from HR teams that they needed more resources to make exit interviews less awkward and more supportive. We built tools as a response. We are just starting to hear that outplacement is becoming more important and are developing our strategy there to pivot to a more comprehensive job transition solution."
