    "When developing one of the biggest challenger crypto banks in LATAM and setting up the infrastructure for it to operate with local banks and liquidity providers. I realized that when expanding to a second country i had to do everything all over again. We were spending 100x more time on operational setups than product market fit. That was the moment i knew there has to be a better way, we are not supposed to push the same solution everywhere bliendly and by brut force, we should be here to empower our clients to achieve their visions, making them more efficient, international, and adaptative to their users needs. That's when CryptoMate was born."
