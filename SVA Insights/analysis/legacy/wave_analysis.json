There are over 20,000 enterprise employers in the US."

      "justification": "Competitors: Headspace, Talkspace, and Better Help are examples of competitors. Wave improves the model by: not leveraging a \u201cone-size fits all\u201d care model, avoiding a short term treatment focus, and leveraging certified coaches as front-line providers of care, truly opening access.\nOne-size-fits-all care: Many competitors rely on standardized therapy models with little personalization. Wave meets members where they are\u2014within hours. Whether someone is stressed, struggling, or in crisis, we deliver same-day support through app-based tools, certified coaching, or a licensed provider when needed.\nShort Term Focus: Many solutions prioritize symptom checklists and brief interventions over sustainable, preventative mental health support. Wave supports individuals with low, moderate and high-acuity needs. Our coaches deliver evidence-based care across acuity levels. \nLack of improvement to access: Many competitors leverage the same pool of licensed mental health providers and continue to weigh down the system. Wave is a coaching-first model, leveraging certified coaches to deliver outcomes immediately to employees in need of support, truly opening access.\nIn-market since: Yes - we brought our product to market in 2023. We spent the first two years in research & development, making sure the product (self-guided app + regular coaching sessions) worked, before we brought it to market."

We have added five new B2B clients in 2025, as well as twelve new partnership deals this year.

  "founder_impact_assessment": [
    "One major learning came from observing the broader behavioral health landscape: despite widespread adoption, many solutions lacked meaningful outcomes data. Employers and payors were investing heavily in mental health benefits but couldn\u2019t measure their impact - leading to questions around ROI and long-term value.\nIn response, we spent two years in research and development before launching Wave, ensuring our stepped-care model could deliver both fast access and measurable outcomes. From day one, we\u2019ve tracked clinical and engagement metrics - like emotional resilience, symptom reduction, and utilization - because we knew outcomes would be essential for driving adoption and proving ROI. This commitment has become a key differentiator and foundation for our success with employers, health plan, and partnership channels."
