  "description": "Toothsome a direct-care benefits platform that allows employers fund and coordinate high-value dental care.",
  "problem_statement": "Dental insurance is outdated and insufficient. Annual coverage caps have barely changed in 40+ years, leaving patients without support for common major procedures. This poor coverage leads to poor utilization of paid benefits. More than $50 billion in dental benefits go unused each year, paid for by US employers. When patients can't afford treatment, they defer care, and deferred care leads to worse health outcomes, including costly emergencies. The result? An estimated $45 billion in productivity loss annually from dental-related absenteeism, and a rise in downstream medical spend due to preventable emergency room and hospital admissions. Toothsome addresses this by giving employers and employees a smarter alternative: a fintech-powered platform combined with a curated center-of-excellence network that coordinates and funds advanced dental care. Initially designed to work alongside insurance, Toothsome helps employers cover what plans miss\u2014while establishing the infrastructure to evolve into a full-stack alternative as adoption scales.",

      "justification": "Target customer: We are targeting mid-sized fully insured employers\u2014especially those not yet offering dental benefits or looking to enhance what they have. Their biggest pain point is the poor ROI on legacy dental benefit spend. Most of premium dollars spent go unused, employees delay care, end some even end up in ERs with preventable oral infections, shifting the cost burden to the medical plans in a way that\u2019s entirely avoidable. Toothsome helps them eliminate waste and fund care that reduces absenteeism, downstream spend, and employee frustration.\nMarket size: The U.S. private dental benefits market is $107B annually. Our initial serviceable market is the $60B that flows through fully insured employers. With a target of reaching just 5% market penetration and a 6% take rate, our near-term opportunity exceeds $95M in annual revenue potential."

The employer-facing platform is in pilot."

  "founder_impact_assessment": [
    "We initially focused on D2C high-value dental services, where insurance offers little to no support. We quickly realized that while the demand was clear, D2C acquisition was too expensive and hard to scale. The turning point came when we helped facilitate a bundled treatment for a patient at a reasonable cash price. This particular patient was an employee of a major insurance company, and insisted that her benefits would cover the treatment. Upon learning that the procedure was not covered, the patient walked away from the care she needed. That moment revealed a critical insight: even highly insured employees misunderstand coverage, and cost still remains a barrier, despite an employer\u2019s  investment and importance placed on health and wellness. The employer, not the patient, ultimately controls access and funding. That insight led us to pivot toward a B2B2C model built around employer-driven care navigation and benefit funding."
