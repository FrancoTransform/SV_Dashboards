  "problem_statement": "Healthcare navigation is broken. Most people don\u2019t know how to find in-network care, what\u2019s covered, or where to go when they need help, resulting in delayed treatment, unnecessary ER visits, and billions in wasted claims. Despite employers and payers spending heavily on benefits, usage is low because the experience is fragmented, slow, and confusing.\n\nSunny Health solves this with an AI-powered concierge that understands your health plan, finds the right providers, checks eligibility in real-time, and books appointments, all through a simple embeddable chat. No apps. No hold times. No guesswork.\n\nThis matters because the current healthcare navigation isn\u2019t just frustrating, it\u2019s costly. It leads to worse outcomes for patients and higher spend for employers and insurers. Our solution increases benefits utilization, improves time-to-care by 60%, and reduces avoidable claims, unlocking ROI for all stakeholders.",

      "justification": "Target customer: Our target customers are self-funded employers and payers. Their biggest pain point is providing high quality, low cost access to care for their employees. There is currently no cost-effective healthcare concierge that is able to solve this problem in real time optimizing for quality, cost, and availability at the same time.\nMarket size: 180m commercial lives + 34m MA lives x $2-5 per member per month = ~$5-13 billion ARR"

      "justification": "Competitors: Our competitors include Transcarent, Accolade, Included Health, and Rightway. They offer care navigation through call centers, apps, or human-led chat, all of which are slow, expensive, and hard to scale.\n\nWhat they get wrong is the assumption that more humans equals better care. In reality, most navigation questions (e.g., \"Is this doctor in-network?\" or \"Can I book an urgent care visit near me today?\") don\u2019t require clinical judgment, they require speed, clarity, and integration with benefits and provider data.\n\nWe\u2019re building an AI-native agent that answers member questions instantly and acts on their behalf, verifying coverage, finding the right provider, and booking the appointment, all in one conversation. No apps to download, no hold music, no re-explaining your benefits.\n\nWhere competitors struggle to scale efficiently and deliver consistent outcomes, we deliver 10x faster access at a fraction of the cost, and drive measurable ROI for employers and payers through better benefit utilization and fewer unnecessary ER visits.\nIn-market since: Our concierge is available for direct to consumer access at sunnyhealth.ai. We have been live for 3 weeks."

  "founder_impact_assessment": [
    "One major piece of feedback we received early on was that while patients loved our AI-powered healthcare navigation experience, employers and payers were skeptical of \u201cyet another point solution.\u201d They didn\u2019t want to add another vendor, they wanted deeper integration with existing systems and measurable ROI on care access, not just a better interface.\n\nThis pushed us to pivot from a standalone AI concierge to an embeddable infrastructure layer that could plug directly into payer portals, PEOs, and employer benefits platforms. \n\nThis change dramatically improved traction with enterprise customers. It taught us that product excellence isn\u2019t enough, you have to meet stakeholders where they are, solve a business problem they own, and plug into their workflows to drive adoption."
