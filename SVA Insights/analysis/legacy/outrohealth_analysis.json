  "description": "The first virtual platform for deprescribing, starting with the 50M Americans on antidepressants. We leverage the first neuroscience-based tapering method, invented by our co-founder.",
  "problem_statement": "We're solving the absence of dedicated deprescribing solutions for several drug classes, used by 100M+ people in the western world. Particularly for psychiatric medications: 10s of millions are using the drugs for longer than guidelines recommend - subject to side effects and long-term effects - and withdrawal symptoms keep them trapped on medications (and drives up healthcare costs). We believe that deprescribing will become a revolutionary category of medicine - a response to the epidemic of overprescribing.",

      "justification": "Target customer: Currently, people who want to stop their antidepressants - expanding to other psych medication classes, and eventually to people who want to get off hard-to-stop medications, in general. Their pain points are that doctors either (1) don't want them to stop meds or (2) don't know how to help them do it (>80% of Rx's by PCPs; though psychiatrists don't know how either).\n\nWith consumer demand and clinical data, we'll grow into a deprescribing platform for payers and employers - reducing current pharmacy spend, future increase, and the cost associated with withdrawal.\nMarket size: Near-term market: Over 100M psychiatric medication prescriptions in the US (most, >2/3, taken longer than guidelines recommend)."

We've been running our first US tapering cohort since June 2024."

  "founder_impact_assessment": [
    "I was working in the psychedelic therapy space doing drug development and clinical infrastructure, after Novo Nordisk and before starting Outro. After 30+ patient interviews, and more messages, it hit me that antidepressants were hard to stop - they aren't these benign multivitamins. People were seeking out psychedelic therapy for the primary reason of trying to get off Lexapro or Prozac, not for depression or anxiety. I learned that antidepressants are hard to stop primarily due to physical dependence and withdrawal, not because people \"relapse\" into depression or anxiety. This learning pivoted me to working on deprescribing."
