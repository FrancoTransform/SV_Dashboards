  "description": "Aidora is an AI-powered leave management platform that helps HR teams manage leave efficiently in-house, at companies of all sizes. By automating administrative tasks, compliance workflows and employee questions, Aidora streamlines the process so HR teams can focus on what matters most: supporting their people.",
  "problem_statement": "Problem: Leave management is one of the most complicated people operations workflows, driven by the increasing number of state-specific leave laws and the rise of hybrid and remote work. Companies of all sizes face significant compliance, financial, and reputational risks when handling leave incorrectly. Existing solutions are primarily service or tech-enabled service models—costly, inconsistent, and often inaccurate—making leave management inaccessible or inefficient for many businesses.\n\nWhy It Matters: Every company, regardless of size or industry, deserves a tech-forward, accessible solution to manage leave with precision and ease. Aidora is building the first truly scalable, AI-powered leave management platform that empowers businesses to navigate leave confidently and efficiently, without sacrificing quality or incurring excessive costs.",
