  "description": "Smirk is redefining the benefits category as the infrastructure layer powering modern health access \u2014 purpose-built for today\u2019s evolving workforce. Our intelligent Health Benefits Wallet empowers individuals to afford both the care they need and the wellness they want \u2014 all through a seamless, personalized, AI-powered experience.",
  "problem_statement": "Smirk is solving the affordability and accessibility crisis in health and wellness benefits \u2014 especially for the 80+ million Americans who don\u2019t receive traditional employer-sponsored coverage. Today\u2019s benefits ecosystem wasn\u2019t built for part-time workers, freelancers, or people changing jobs frequently. As a result, most people are either underinsured or completely left out \u2014 forced to pay out of pocket for essential care like dental, mental health, and wellness services, often with no guidance, support, or financial flexibility. This matters because Americans now spend over $1 trillion out of pocket each year on their health. Without better tools, millions delay or skip care, driving worse health outcomes and rising financial stress. Smirk makes it easy for individuals to find, afford, and manage the care they need \u2014 by unifying insurance, curated discounts, and embedded financing into a single, portable Benefits Wallet designed for today\u2019s workforce.",
