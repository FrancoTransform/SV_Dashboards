  "description": "Petunia is a Wellness Benefit that helps busy families (GenX & Millennials) discover & decide on Senior Living for their Aging Loved Ones. Petunia provides unbiased tools, structure and guidance to help you make a life-changing decision for a Loved One, confidently.",
  "problem_statement": "When aging in place is not an option or not preferred, choosing where your aging Loved One will live becomes a stressful, high-stakes decision, yet 200,000 families a year face this decision with almost no guidance. Across the 11MM Sandwich Generation employees in the workforce, and with more Baby Boomers turning 80 daily, this problem is accelerating rapidly.\n\nFor Families: Today, families have 3 paths to navigate the Assisted Living or Memory Care decision - one they\u2019re making for their Loved One with their Loved One\u2019s money:\n(1) Referral sites and \"consultants\" who get paid $5-10,000 only when your Loved One moves in. When advisors are incentivized to place your Loved One with a Community where they have a referral fee agreement, are they really working for you?\n(2) Online directories that function like paid advertising platforms; communities pay to boost their listings, so what you see isn't necessarily what's best for your family.\n(3) Google, spreadsheets, and hope - families struggle through 70+ hours of research, tours, and coordination with zero structure or guidance, leading to confusion, frustration, and doubt about such a critical decision.\n\nFor Employers: This decision process takes a toll on your workforce. Nearly 2 full work weeks are lost per affected employee as they navigate community tours, appointments, and assessments - all occurring during business hours. Your most valuable mid-career and senior employees (GenX & Millennials) are already stretched thin with Sandwich Generation responsibilities and now face this significant emotional and practical strain. As the largest generation in history ages, a significant portion of your workforce will face this decision in the coming years, making the productivity and retention impact massive.\n\nWhy Petunia matters: We step in after families Google \"Assisted Living Near Me\" and provide tools, structure and unbiased guidance to help them make an informed, confident Senior Living decision on behalf of their Loved One.",
