  "description": "Stance Health is an AI-powered virtual therapy marketplace that delivers specialized psychotherapy to 67 million chronic pain sufferers. We provide clinically proven, non-drug behavioral health treatments to patients that can\u2019t access or afford care.",
  "problem_statement": "Chronic pain drives $635B in annual costs, outpacing the combined costs of cancer and diabetes. It\u2019s the leading driver of opioid prescriptions, fueling a $1T opioid crisis. The gold-standard biopsychosocial model of care requires behavioral health intervention, but most physicians lack referral access to pain-specialized psychotherapists. Stance Health solves this by connecting chronic pain patients directly to licensed therapists trained in evidence-based chronic pain interventions - reducing costs, improving function, and preventing opioid dependence. This crisis claims lives daily. Families lose homes to bankruptcy from the cost of chronic pain care. Millions of Americans become dependent on opioids prescribed for pain. Without access to pain-specialized therapists, doctors are unable to deliver the gold-standard biopsychosocial model, leaving patients to suffer indefinitely, families devastated, and society bearing enormous financial and emotional costs.",
