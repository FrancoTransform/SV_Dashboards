  "problem_statement": "We're tackling the US eating habits crisis. The market today is full of solutions that are either economically unviable, like GLPs, or lack meaningful impact. We're bringing effective, scalable, and cost-efficient 1:1 nutrition to US employers. Whether as an alternative to GLPs (at 1/24th of the cost and 2.5x higher adherence) or as a layer that makes covering GLPs a more viable decision.",
