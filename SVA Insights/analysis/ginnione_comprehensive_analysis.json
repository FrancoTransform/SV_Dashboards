  "description": "Ginni One is a gold-focused fintech for India, unifying UPI payments and digital gold investing. It features a gold rewards credit card that turns everyday spending into gold. With AI-driven insights, regulation-first partnerships, and B2C+B2B reach, Ginni One scales responsibly and aims to expand across emerging markets, including Southeast Asia.",
  "problem_statement": "Everyday spending doesn\u2019t build assets; rewards are fragmented, opaque, and often expire. Gold is trusted but hard to accumulate: purity, pricing, storage, and scattered apps add friction. UPI/card payments rarely convert into owned, 24K-backed gold; no automatic micro-investment. Portfolios are fragmented with poor visibility and control. Merchants/issuers burn margins on generic points with weak retention/differentiation. Gold-based rewards are complex to run (valuation, custody, reconciliation). Legacy rewards optimize for breakage, not customer prosperity. Why now: UPI/card ubiquity, mature KYC, and digital-gold rails make it feasible. Ginni One: turns every transaction into transparent, auditable gold ownership via a gold rewards credit card.",
