  "problem_statement": "As the U.S. population ages, the country faces a projected shortage of over two million clinicians over the next decade, spanning nurses, aides, and other essential healthcare roles. This Care Crisis threatens patient access, quality of care, and the stability of the entire healthcare system. Addressing the crisis requires a multi-pronged approach - training more clinicians, improving retention, and making healthcare careers more sustainable. At Carefam, we\u2019re starting where impact can be felt fastest: optimizing how the existing clinical workforce finds its next job and thrives once in it. By reducing friction in hiring, helping clinicians grow their careers, and improving retention, we strengthen the backbone of the entire healthcare system. A high-functioning healthcare workforce is one of the most important imperatives for ensuring America\u2019s health and prosperity in the decades ahead",
