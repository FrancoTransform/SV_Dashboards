  "description": "CognitiveView is an AI Governance platform for regulated industries. Our audit module, TRACE\u00e2\u0080\u0091RAI, transforms GenAI evaluation scores into signed, compliance-ready evidence. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re helping hospitals, governments, and enterprises meet HIPAA, HITRUST, and EU AI Act requirements\u00e2\u0080\u0094already deployed across 80\u00e2\u0080\u0093100 hospitals and piloting with the U.S. Department of Defense.",
  "problem_statement": "GenAI adoption is outpacing regulation, and enterprises \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially in healthcare and government \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have no standardized way to prove their AI systems are safe, fair, or compliant. Existing tools generate metrics, but not audit-ready evidence. This gap blocks procurement, increases risk, and erodes trust in critical sectors.",
