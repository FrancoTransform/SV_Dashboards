    "description": "Hero is a smartphone-based VO₂ Max assessment app delivering science-backed health and fitness insights using only the phone's camera—no wearables or lab visits required.",
    "problem_statement": "Hero addresses the global health crisis of declining cardiorespiratory fitness, a top predictor of mortality. Traditional VO₂ Max testing is costly, time-consuming, and inaccessible for the general population. Hero democratizes access to this vital metric using validated camera-based tech, enabling preventative health action, especially for the insurance industry which currently lacks scalable tools for population risk assessment and engagement.",
