  "description": "GTMFlow equips executives and organizations with the mindset and tools to thrive through curveballs—unexpected challenges that disrupt performance. Our executive cancer coaching is a scalable benefit that supports employees navigating diagnosis or caregiving, helping them balance work, treatment, and communication to stay resilient and productive.",
  "problem_statement": "A cancer diagnosis is profoundly destabilizing—especially for executives responsible for leading teams, driving strategy, and managing critical customer and investor relationships. These leaders are expected to deliver clarity, momentum, and stability—while suddenly navigating medical decisions, emotional strain, and physical disruption. Most employers offer insurance and clinical support, but they lack real-time, experienced, executive-centric coaching to help executives process the diagnosis, communicate with stakeholders, and balance their dual responsibilities to their health and their company.\n\nWithout targeted support, executives often withdraw, make reactive decisions, or disappear from the business when their leadership is most needed. This creates ripple effects across teams and priorities, leading to unnecessary leaves, stalled initiatives, and cultural instability. GTMFlow closes this gap by delivering executive-grade coaching that helps leaders develop a plan, communicate confidently, and stay engaged—so they can protect their health and business continuity.",
