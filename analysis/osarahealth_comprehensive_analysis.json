  "description": "Osara Health is a digital health company that helps people affected by cancer achieve better clinical outcomes and return to work sooner. We operate in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the US, partnering with top insurers and employers with our proven Cancer Coach and Caregiver programs.",
  "problem_statement": "For patients\nPeople with cancer often face unmanaged symptoms, treatment side effects, and emotional strain, leading to poorer clinical outcomes. We provide a dedicated Cancer Coach who guides behavior change, supports symptom tracking, encourages exercise, and improves mental health, helping patients recover faster and avoid preventable complications.\n\nFor caregivers\nFamily members and friends supporting someone with cancer often experience burnout, anxiety, and health issues of their own. Our Cancer Caregivers program gives them tools, education, and emotional support, improving their wellbeing, resilience, and ability to manage work and caregiving, while improving care for their loved one.\n\nFor disability insurers\nCancer is one of the most costly disability claim conditions. The Cancer Coach program is demonstrated in a peer-reviewed publication to shorten claim durations while improving the member experience.\n\nFor health plans\nCancer is consistently a top claim cost. A portion of cancer costs are due to avoidable admissions, which can be ameliorated by a patient having better mental health and more proactively managing their symptoms. \n\nFor employers\nCancer disrupts workforce participation and productivity. We help employees return to work sooner and more sustainably, improving retention and reducing absenteeism. Our programs demonstrate measurable savings in both medical and productivity-related costs.",
