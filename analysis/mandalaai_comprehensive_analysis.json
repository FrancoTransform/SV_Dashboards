  "description": "Cursor for Managers; Mandala builds AI that automatically writes perf reviews, and preps 1:1 agendas \u2014eliminating 210 hours/year of manager busywork while improving review accuracy and reducing bias.",
  "problem_statement": "We're solving the performance management crisis that's costing enterprises billions while burning out managers. Research shows managers spend 210 hours annually on performance reviews alone -- time stolen from actual leadership. Despite companies spending $2.35 billion globally on performance management software, only 2% of CHROs think their performance management system works. The root cause? Current tools still require managers to manually input, remember, and synthesize performance data. It's like asking developers to code in Notepad when they could use an IDE. Mandala solves this by automatically generating performance artifacts from behavioral signals. Our AI analyzes Slack communication patterns, calendar collaboration data, and project contributions to write reviews, prep 1:1s, and compile promotion cases -- eliminating manual work while improving accuracy and reducing recency bias. This matters now because leader and manager development is the top HR priority for 2025 for the third consecutive year, while managers spend only 28% of their time actually managing employees.",
