Our coaching platform supports skills validation and integration through immersive, AI Role Plays, and in the work flow feedback. With Virtual Sapiens, employees improve in measurable and sustainable ways, at scale.",
  "problem_statement": "Corporate training programs are one size fits all and 'check the box'. Real ROI is impossible to measure and miscommunication, lost productivity and low engagement leads to over $1.2 Trillion in lost revenue opportunities. Our platform meets a gap in market when it comes to the integration and validation of essential skills at mid to large companies. With our platform integrated into new hire onboarding, general employee upskilling and manager training, companies empower their teams to thrive, own their impact and deliver at scale.",
