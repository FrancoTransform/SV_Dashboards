  "description": "Wiggl Health's AI-powered prevention platform enables 50M+ hybrid and remote employees worldwide in the workplace wellness industry to avoid costly MSK injuries, reduce workers' comp claims by 60%, and improve productivity by 25% by transforming once-a-year ergonomic assessments into 8,760 daily micro-checks using passive sensing from existing devices.",
  "problem_statement": "Workplace MSK injuries cost employers $45-54B annually, but current prevention relies on useless once-yearly ergonomic checks. By the time employees feel pain, costly damage is done. With 50M+ remote workers in unmonitored home offices, companies are blind to brewing injuries until expensive claims hit.",
