  "description": "BetterYou is a healthy habits companion that helps people find more time in the day for their health. Our product optimizes time for teams, making it easier to achieve health. Stanford researchers found that having BetterYou in your pocket improved sleep by 32 minutes/night.",
  "problem_statement": "Enterprise software has seen a shift toward consumer level experiences from products that are too clunky or don’t see the uptake they need to survive in the market. Wellness software from the 2010s failed. They saw positive impact and ROI in isolation ($3.21 saved for every $1 spent), but didn't deliver those results in practice. That's because an employee isn't a test subject. They don't have to use the product. We drive 3x the average engagement rate and help companies actually unlock the value of their wellness program",
