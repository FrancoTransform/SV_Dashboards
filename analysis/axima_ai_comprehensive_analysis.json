  "description": "Axima.ai - building AI agents that help medical groups collect 99%+ of revenue at 70% lower cost.",
  "problem_statement": "We solve the massive inefficiency in the U.S. healthcare revenue cycle, where medical centers annually:\n1. Lose or freeze $494B due to denied or delayed insurance claims;\n2. Miss out on $736B in patient payments due to low collection rates (47.8%);\n3. Spend $600B chasing payments with outdated, manual processes.\n\nWe had a conversation with 30+ medical groups and everybody told us that receiving payments from payors and patients is the one of the biggest challenge in their business.",
