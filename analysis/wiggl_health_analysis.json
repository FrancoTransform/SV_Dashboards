  "description": "Wiggl Health's AI-powered prevention platform enables 50M+ hybrid and remote employees worldwide in the workplace wellness industry to avoid costly MSK injuries, reduce workers' comp claims by 60%, and improve productivity by 25% by transforming once-a-year ergonomic assessments into 8,760 daily micro-checks using passive sensing from existing devices.",
  "problem_statement": "Workplace MSK injuries cost employers $45-54B annually, but current prevention relies on useless once-yearly ergonomic checks. By the time employees feel pain, costly damage is done. With 50M+ remote workers in unmonitored home offices, companies are blind to brewing injuries until expensive claims hit.",

Workplace wellness platforms (Virgin Pulse, Wellhub) offer generic solutions with self-reporting bias that can't predict or prevent MSK injuries. All competitors share the same fatal flaw: they're reactive solutions built for centralized offices, while Wiggl Health is the only predictive platform designed for distributed workforces using passive AI monitoring.\nIn-market since: We are just going to market now."
