  "description": "Magier AI is an enterprise-grade AI DLP platform that lets employers unlock GenAI productivity without risking HIPAA or GDPR leaks. Our real-time engine scrubs 150+ PII types in ≤30 ms, integrates with any LLM or browser, and equips brokers and health plans to deploy AI safely—trusted by gener8tor firms.",
  "problem_statement": "Generative-AI adoption is racing ahead of security: 75% of employees already paste customer or patient data into ChatGPT-style tools. Each prompt can exfiltrate HIPAA- or GDPR-protected PII/PHI, exposing employers, brokers, and health plans to average breach costs of $4.45 M, $50k-per-record fines, and lost IP. Legacy DLP can’t scan natural-language prompts or respond in real time, so CISOs either ban GenAI—surrendering a projected 30% productivity lift—or accept existential risk. Magier eliminates the trade-off by redacting 150+ sensitive data types in ≤30 ms at the browser and API layer, letting organizations unlock GenAI safely and compliantly.",
