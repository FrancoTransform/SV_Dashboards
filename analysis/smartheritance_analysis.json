  "description": "SmartHeritance is a digital legacy planning platform that helps individuals organize and securely pass on everything their loved ones will need - from financial, digital and personal assets to ongoing expenses. \n\nThe reality is, most families face stress, confusion and financial loss when a loved one passes - simply because vital information is scattered, or missing. SmartHeritance solves this by automating the discovery, organization, and secure sharing of key information - ensuring nothing gets lost or unclaimed.\n\nYour legacy is fully preserved and passed on with ease, giving you peace of mind and providing a clear path for your family when it matters most.",
  "problem_statement": "Most families are caught off guard when a loved one passes away. Critical information\u2014like financial accounts, insurance policies, and digital assets\u2014is often scattered or hidden, leaving survivors overwhelmed and unprepared. \n\nThis leads to lost assets, missed benefits, and emotional strain during an already difficult time. SmartHeritance helps individuals organize and securely share key information, so their families aren\u2019t left in the dark when it matters most.\n\nA common pitfall in legacy planning is the lack of ongoing discipline\u2014people may start organizing their affairs but rarely keep things updated. Survivors often don\u2019t know what exists, or who to contact when someone passes away. As a result, assets go unclaimed and critical benefits are missed. SmartHeritance addresses this with automated asset discovery and periodic wellness checks, ensuring that vital information stays current and reaches the right people automatically when it matters most.",

  "founder_impact_assessment": [
    "Early on, I realized through user interviews that legacy planning is like dental floss\u2014everyone knows they should do it, but almost no one actually does. The barrier wasn\u2019t about importance; it was about discipline, emotional resistance, and the sheer effort involved.\n\nPeople weren\u2019t just avoiding legal documents\u2014they were overwhelmed by the time it takes to track expenses, organize assets, and keep everything current. Many also pointed out that day-to-day financial details and expenses are a vital part of a family legacy, yet they\u2019re often ignored.\n\nThat feedback changed everything. I saw clearly that automation wasn\u2019t a nice-to-have\u2014it was the only way to overcome apathy and make this stick. We pivoted SmartHeritance to focus on a simple, intuitive UI layered with automated asset discovery and wellness checks, turning legacy planning into an easy, ongoing habit. Our goal became clear: reduce the emotional and logistical burden, so families are never left scrambling in the dark."
