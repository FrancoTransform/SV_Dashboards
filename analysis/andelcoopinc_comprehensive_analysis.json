  "description": "Andel is a membership service and pharmacy benefit building a fairer way to get life-changing drugs. Insurance isn't working. And individuals can't afford to pay cash. But as a group, Andel members get guaranteed access\u2014at a more affordable price.",
  "problem_statement": "The era of life-changing drugs is upon us. Obesity. Diabetes. Alzheimer\u2019s. Cancer. There\u2019s just one problem: traditional payers can\u2019t afford them. In 2025, outpatient prescription drug costs are projected to rise by 11.4%, up from a 9.9% increase in 2024. This is driven by an unprecedented combination of price, applicability, and indefinite use. Thanks to advances in AI-generated drug discovery and personalized medicine, there will soon be many new classes of drugs which are exceptionally beneficial but fundamentally uninsurable.",
