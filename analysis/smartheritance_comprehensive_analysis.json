  "description": "SmartHeritance is a digital legacy planning platform that helps individuals organize and securely pass on everything their loved ones will need - from financial, digital and personal assets to ongoing expenses. The reality is, most families face stress, confusion and financial loss when a loved one passes - simply because vital information is scattered, or missing. SmartHeritance solves this by automating the discovery, organization, and secure sharing of key information - ensuring nothing gets lost or unclaimed. Your legacy is fully preserved and passed on with ease, giving you peace of mind and providing a clear path for your family when it matters most.",
  "problem_statement": "Most families are caught off guard when a loved one passes away. Critical information—like financial accounts, insurance policies, and digital assets—is often scattered or hidden, leaving survivors overwhelmed and unprepared. This leads to lost assets, missed benefits, and emotional strain during an already difficult time. SmartHeritance helps individuals organize and securely share key information, so their families aren’t left in the dark when it matters most. A common pitfall in legacy planning is the lack of ongoing discipline—people may start organizing their affairs but rarely keep things updated. Survivors often don’t know what exists, or who to contact when someone passes away. As a result, assets go unclaimed and critical benefits are missed. SmartHeritance addresses this with automated asset discovery and periodic wellness checks, ensuring that vital information stays current and reaches the right people automatically when it matters most.",
