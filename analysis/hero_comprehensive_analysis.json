  "description": "Hero is a smartphone-based VO₂ Max Assessment, delivering science-backed health and fitness insights using only a member’s phone camera. No wearables, no lab visits—just validated, real-time metrics of the most attributable factor in all cause mortality, cardiorespiratory fitness, in 2 minutes.",
  "problem_statement": "We have a global health crisis. We are becoming less active and more sedentary, impacting cardiorespiratory fitness. Having a low cardiorespiratory fitness is the most attributable factor in all cause mortality, more impactful than being obese, having diabetes or being a smoker. Cardiorespiratory fitness is measured via VO2 Max, which indicates how effectively and efficiently we are utilising oxygen to exist and perform activity. We as a society do not measure VO2 Max and do not have an understanding of it. Why? VO2 Max testing exists primarily in the elite sports performance setting, due to the inconvenient, costly and scarcity of laboratory testing facilities. Hero exists to deliver VO2 Max at scale via smartphone camera technology, to democratise access to the metric by removing inconvenience and prohibitive costs. Hero believes that an objective measure of cardiorespiratory fitness is critical in educating, supporting and improving health outcomes at a population level. Improving health outcomes via VO2 Max improvements have hugely significant and well researched financial associated benefits, witnessed in healthcare spend and insurance claims. The objectives and benefits to healthcare/insurance industry and the health of our population are aligned in mission. Be preventative, improve health, reduce cost.",
