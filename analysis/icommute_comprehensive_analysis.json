  "description": "iCommute is an AI-native shared mobility platform serving universities and corporate campuses.",
  "problem_statement": "Daily campus and workplace commutes are broken:\n\nTime wasted – Students and employees lose ≈2 hours a day on unreliable transit or traffic.\n\nHigh costs – Parking passes, fuel, and rideshares can exceed $300/month—often unaffordable for cash-strapped students or low-income staff.\n\nEnvironmental mandates – 75 % of cars arriving on North-American campuses carry one occupant, inflating parking demand and Scope-3 CO₂ emissions that institutions must now report under new IFRS S2/SEC rules.\n\nWhy it matters: Universities and employers face a triple squeeze: limited land for new $5 k–$15 k parking stalls, rising sustainability targets, and retention challenges as commuters push back against return-to-office mandates. Students and staff feel the pinch in lost time, tight budgets, and climate anxiety. Solving this unlocks measurable benefits—lower commute costs, happier commuters, reduced parking build-out, and verifiable CO₂ cuts—making efficient, shared mobility a strategic priority rather than a “nice-to-have.",
