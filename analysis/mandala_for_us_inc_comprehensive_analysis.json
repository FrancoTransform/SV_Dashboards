  "description": "Mandala is an AI Leadership Coach that lives in Slack and helps employees prioritize, give feedback, and build resilience—right inside their workflow.",
  "problem_statement": "69% of U.S. employees are disengaged at work, costing the global economy $8.8 trillion. The largest driver of engagement is the manager, but 55% of managers are burnt out and ill-equipped to coach their teams. While traditional leadership training and executive coaching exist, they either don’t scale or don’t stick. Mandala solves this by embedding leadership coaching directly into employees’ daily flow of work, helping them prioritize better, give clearer feedback, and build emotional resilience—all via Slack and Teams.",
