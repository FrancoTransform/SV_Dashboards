  "description": "Beacon is building the data layer to underwrite hiring. They start by identifying, verifying, and matching top specialty recruiters with employers using AI, fixing the broken front door to talent acquisition. This unlocks recruiter-led sourcing, referrals, and productivity, and sets the stage for a future where hiring is fully data-backed and risk-mitigated.",
  "problem_statement": "Hiring today is unverified guesswork, and it is costing companies billions. Recruiters are often the first and most important decision in a search, but are chosen by gut, not data. Beacon is building the infrastructure to underwrite hiring by verifying and matching specialty recruiters using AI. This improves sourcing, referral quality, and recruiter productivity, but more importantly, it lays the foundation for de-risked, data-driven hiring.",
