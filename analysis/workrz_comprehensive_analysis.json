  "description": "Workrz (Techstars '24 / Workforce) helps fast-food and grocery chains tackle 66%+ turnover by offering a new AI-powered employment model. We turn hourly workers into a shared, flexible, long-term W-2 workforce, ensuring businesses are fully staffed and enabling workers to flexibly choose shifts across up to three businesses.",
  "problem_statement": "The service industry, including supermarkets and fast-food chains, faces a 66% turnover rate, costing businesses up to 20% of their profits. This churn is driven by a workforce that increasingly values flexibility and control over rigid, outdated schedules. Traditional employment models exclude large segments of the population, such as young parents, students, and pensioners, who are willing to work but can’t commit to inflexible hours.",
