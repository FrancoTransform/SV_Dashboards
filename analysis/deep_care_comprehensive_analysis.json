  "description": "Deep-Care is a German healthtech startup founded by ex-Bosch and ex-Tesla engineers. Our AI workstation companion ‘Isa’ improves posture, movement, cognitive factors for desk workers—while building a digital twin for health insights. Scientifically validated, privacy-compliant, and used by 200+ companies in Europe, Isa is now expanding into the U.S.",
  "problem_statement": "We tackle the massive health and cost burden caused by sedentary desk work. Poor posture, low movement, and suboptimal environments lead to musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders—some of the most expensive and disabling conditions in modern healthcare. In the U.S. alone, musculoskeletal disorders account for one out of every six dollars spent on healthcare, as highlighted by Evernorth: https://www.evernorth.com/articles/musculoskeletal-disorder-costs-and-cares.\n\nOur AI workstation companion ‘Isa’ addresses these root causes directly at the desk—improving posture, movement, hydration, and environmental factors like light and noise. The solution has been scientifically validated by leading European research institutions and top-tier universities, and is already used by over 200 organizations—including Mercedes-Benz, McKinsey, UBS, the German Army, and major public insurers. ‘Isa’ drives early behavior change, reduces chronic health risks, and helps lower long-term costs while improving employee well-being and productivity.",
