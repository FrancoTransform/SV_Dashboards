  "description": "Hera Fertility is an AI-powered platform that helps men understand and improve their sperm health through advanced semen analysis, empowering them to optimize fertility and become fathers sooner.",
  "problem_statement": "Sperm counts have dropped 60% since the 1970s, and 180 million couples now face infertility\u2014yet 50% of cases involving male factors remain overlooked. Employers and health plans are rapidly expanding fertility benefits, but even when they cover semen analysis, there's no intelligence behind it\u2014just clinical numbers without actionable insights. This drives unnecessary $30,000 IVF cycles with 70% failure rates. Hera transforms raw semen analysis data into AI-powered optimization plans, giving benefits providers the first scalable solution to improve male fertility outcomes and reduce downstream treatment costs.",
