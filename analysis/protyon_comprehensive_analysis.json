  "description": "Protyon is a software and service startup using advanced in silico molecular modeling technologies to support oncologists and molecular pathologists in choosing the most effective therapy. Our platform significantly reduces the number of non-responders of expensive advanced targeted therapy drugs by helping interpret rare or previously unseen mutations found in tumor sequencing data.",
  "problem_statement": "Protyon\u2019s solution addresses the significant waste on misaligned targeted cancer drugs, high therapy costs, and a high percentage of non-responders. The business case highlights substantial issues in cancer treatment: \u20ac16B is wasted annually on misaligned advanced targeted drugs, which cost about \u20ac0.3M per course. In 2022, there were 2.5M new lung cancer cases and 1.8M deaths. Notably, 40% of patients do not respond to these therapies, and 30% present novel mutations lacking treatment guidelines.",
