Our coaching platform supports skills validation and integration through immersive, AI Role Plays, and in the work flow feedback. With Virtual Sapiens, employees improve in measurable and sustainable ways, at scale.",
  "problem_statement": "Corporate training programs are one size fits all and 'check the box'. Real ROI is impossible to measure and miscommunication, lost productivity and low engagement leads to over $1.2 Trillion in lost revenue opportunities. Our platform meets a gap in market when it comes to the integration and validation of essential skills at mid to large companies. With our platform integrated into new hire onboarding, general employee upskilling and manager training, companies empower their teams to thrive, own their impact and deliver at scale.",

      "justification": "Target customer: Talent development, learning and development are our biggest buyers. They are getting pressure to report out on the ROI of trainings and ensure trainings are supporting their workforce for real impact. To date, many trainings are 'check the box' with no real way (apart from surveys no one fills out) to measure improvement across a series of learning frameworks and methodologies. Our platform supports this through easy to customize role plays and skills validation exercises. Our platform also supports a variety of communication contexts (phone calls, in person and virtual) providing the more robust and nuanced feedback across nonverbal, verbal and vocal metrics.\nMarket size: The US L&D/training market currently sits at around $98B. Our more specific, bottom up market analysis shows $2.2B in combined market potential with L&D/sales training, Sales training firms and LMS systems we can integrated into."
