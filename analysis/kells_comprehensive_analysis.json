  "description": "KELLS is an AI-powered dental benefits platform designed to make oral care more accessible, affordable, and personalized.",
  "problem_statement": "KELLS is modernizing legacy dental benefits to fill the gap in accessibility, transparency and affordability. Over 25% U.S. population doesn't have dental benefits, 100MM people skip dental care due to cost, inconvenience and fear, including ones with dental insurance. Untreated dental issues cause $40B productivity loss, and are linked to chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease, driving up overall healthcare costs, while most dental problems can be prevented with timely intervention. KELLS is changing the paradigm with AI-powered virtual care and upfront, lower cost provider network.",
