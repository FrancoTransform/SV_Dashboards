  "description": "Bivicare helps self-insured employers to pay healthcare providers through direct cash discounts, by de-risking those transactions with real-time claim adjudication. These pay-now cash discounts can save employers hundreds of thousands of dollars, and save providers months of time and effort to get paid.",
  "problem_statement": "46K self-insured employers in the U.S. (covering 35M people) struggle to control their healthcare spending, which has grown 3x faster than wages over the last 10 years. On the other side, healthcare providers hate dealing with insurance companies (a.k.a. the employers\u2019 third-party administrators, or TPAs) to get reimbursed \u2013 1/3 of all claims take more than 90 days to be paid, with a ton of administrative hassle and cash-flow issues in between that strain their business operations.",
