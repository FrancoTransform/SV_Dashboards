  "description": "GigHQ.ai is the job seeker's AI copilot. We fix the broken job search with a personal CRM that automates application tracking, provides smart reminders, and delivers data-driven insights. We empower candidates to take control of their careers and find their next opportunity.",
  "problem_statement": "The modern job search is fundamentally broken for the individual, a manual and chaotic process that has become a job in itself. Job seekers are left to manage their search with cumbersome spreadsheets while navigating a system where the existing tools are built to support the employer, not them. This results in a frustrating lack of transparency where applicants are often 'ghosted,' a practice that erodes their confidence and leaves them without the feedback needed to improve their search.",

While the market opportunity is large, more proof of sustainable growth and enterprise traction is needed before advancing."
