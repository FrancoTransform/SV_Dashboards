  "description": "GigHQ.ai is the job seeker's AI copilot. We fix the broken job search with a personal CRM that automates application tracking, provides smart reminders, and delivers data-driven insights. We empower candidates to take control of their careers and find their next opportunity.",
  "problem_statement": "The modern job search is fundamentally broken for the individual, a manual and chaotic process that has become a job in itself. Job seekers are left to manage their search with cumbersome spreadsheets while navigating a system where the existing tools are built to support the employer, not them. This results in a frustrating lack of transparency where applicants are often 'ghosted,' a practice that erodes their confidence and leaves them without the feedback needed to improve their search.\n\nThis broken system matters because its impact is both deeply personal and economically significant. For individuals, it creates immense uncertainty and stress—a recurring pain point in a world where workers now change careers 5-7 times in a lifetime. Economically, this inefficiency is staggering. It takes a new graduate, on average, six months and hundreds of hours to find an entry-level job. This contributes to massive public costs, with Federal Unemployment Insurance forecasted to grow from ~$40 billion in 2025 to ~$60 billion by 2035.",
