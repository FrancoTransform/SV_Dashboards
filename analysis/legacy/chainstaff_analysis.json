  "description": "chainstaff is a referral-powered hiring platform that helps companies fill roles faster by activating internal and external networks. Jobs are shared with bounties, and rewards are distributed to active participants. No upfront cost, fully automated, and infinitely scalable - turning every person into a recruiter.",
  "problem_statement": "Hiring is broken: it\u2019s expensive, slow, and relies on outdated systems. While referrals consistently deliver the best candidates, they are limited to employees, hard to manage, and impossible to scale.\n\nchainstaff changes that. We transform the referral process into an open, incentivized, and fully automated system - enabling anyone, not just employees, to share jobs and earn rewards when hires are made. This unlocks entirely new distribution channels for companies: alumni, freelancers, industry experts, and niche communities become your extended recruiting force.\n\nWith zero upfront cost and clear ROI on every hire, chainstaff turns network-based hiring into a scalable engine for growth. We\u2019re not just improving referrals, we\u2019re building the infrastructure for open, performance-based recruiting.",

      "justification": "Target customer: Our target customers are mid-sized companies (50-250 employees), especially in sectors facing labor shortages and skill gaps - such as healthcare, manufacturing, logistics, and tech. Although we are also in contact with large corporations since our solutions fits in their need too.\n\nTheir biggest pain points vary, but they share a common theme: hiring is inefficient, costly, and hard to scale. Specifically:\n\nCost predictability: Traditional recruiting channels are expensive and unpredictable. With chainstaff, companies set the bounty upfront and only pay on successful hires, giving full control over hiring spend.\n\nScaling referrals: Many companies already use internal referral programs but want to expand reach beyond employees. We enable them to tap into external networks without additional complexity.\n\nManual processes: Some companies still manage referrals in Excel, with manual tracking and payments. chainstaff fully automates the process making it seamless, transparent, and scalable.\n\nWe help these companies reduce costs, accelerate time-to-hire, and unlock the full potential of network-based recruiting - all without upfront risk.\nMarket size: We\u2019re initially targeting medium-sized companies (50\u2013250 employees) in the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland). This segment includes approximately 10,000 companies employing around 6 million people. With a typical net job fluctuation of ~10%, this results in 600,000 job changes annually within this segment alone."

      "justification": "Competitors: Our competitors include:\n\nTraditional recruiting agencies (e.g. Hays, Adecco): These are expensive (15\u201330% of first-year salary), slow, and not performance-aligned. They also offer limited transparency and scalability.\n\nJob platforms (e.g. LinkedIn, Indeed): While they offer reach, they don\u2019t activate networks or offer incentives for successful referrals. It\u2019s pay-to-post, not pay-for-performance.\n\nInternal referral tools (e.g. Firstbird, Radancy): These focus only on employees, closed systems that don\u2019t scale beyond the company. They often require upfront SaaS fees and don\u2019t solve the real distribution challenge.\n\nWhat they get wrong:\nThey treat referrals as an add-on - we treat them as the core channel. Most fail to unlock the full power of external networks or to build fair, automated reward mechanisms. chainstaff is designed to be radically simple, risk-free (pay only on success), and infinitely scalable, turning every person into a recruiter without friction.\nIn-market since: Yes. We launched an early prototype in August 2024 to test core mechanics and validate market interest. After closing that phase in November, we began building the full MVP based on feedback. We're currently in active development while gradually onboarding new companies, jobs, and referrers to prepare for a broader launch."

      "justification": "Traction: Over the last 6 months, we\u2019ve built early traction while testing and refining the model:\n\n- 5 successful hires through the platform\n\n- 550+ users engaged as referrers\n\n- 90 job listings published by early partner companies\n\n- Hire success rate currently matches traditional job ads (~5\u20136%)\n\nThese results validate both demand and usability. We're now focused on improving conversion through targeted onboarding, better job-referrer matching, and performance analytics - with the goal of reaching a 10% success rate by end of 2025, and 15%+ by 2026.\n\nWe\u2019ve proven the concept works, now we\u2019re scaling it.\nCustomers: We\u2019ve onboarded around 40 companies to date, primarily small and mid-sized businesses across Switzerland. We're now focused on converting these early users into recurring customers and brand ambassadors, leveraging their networks to drive awareness and referrals.\n\nOur sales pipeline includes:\n\n- 3 larger Swiss corporations currently in active discussions, and several medium sized.\n- A growing outreach to German mid-sized firms, supported by our advisory team\n- Ongoing efforts to expand into sectors with high talent needs (e.g. healthcare, logistics, IT)\n\nAt this stage, we rely heavily on personal introductions and relationship-based selling. While not yet fully scalable, this approach has proven to be the most effective for gaining trust and access to decision-makers in the early phase. As we grow, we plan to formalize our sales funnel and layer in outbound automation and partnerships to scale acquisition.\nPricing: So far, 5 companies have paid referral fees. At this stage, there is no additional pricing model, allowing us to focus on traction and product-market fit. However, we plan to introduce a licensing and subscription-based model for larger organizations starting in Q3 2025, offering advanced features such as branded portals, analytics, and internal program automation."

This gives us the best of both worlds: the speed and quality of an experienced product team, with aligned incentives and no outsourcing risk. Importantly, it allows us to stay lean, we avoid fixed personnel costs when not actively building, so we can focus capital on growth and distribution. This setup is intentional and efficient for our current stage. As we scale, we plan to gradually build out key product and engineering roles within chainstaff to bring those capabilities fully in-house."

  "founder_impact_assessment": [
    "One of the most important pieces of feedback we received early on was that our original vision - building a blockchain-based CV verification and skill-matching infrastructure - was too ambitious and too abstract for immediate market adoption. While technically exciting, it lacked a clear entry point and monetization path.\n\nWe listened. Instead of forcing a big, complex idea, we zoomed in on a very real and painful problem every company faces.\n\nThat learning led us to pivot - from a future-facing tech stack to a practical, ROI-driven platform. We kept the spirit of our original vision (empowering individuals to own and monetize their data), but grounded it in a tangible, urgent solution companies could adopt today. That shift gave us traction, revenue, and momentum."
