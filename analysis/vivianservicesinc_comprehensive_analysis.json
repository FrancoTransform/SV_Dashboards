  "description": "Vivian transforms employer-sponsored health insurance with flexible, tax-advantaged funds for everyday care, true insurance for life\u2019s surprises, and a dedicated CareConcierge to eliminate friction. Members save, roll over unused funds, and get support when they need it, creating a benefits experience that employees love and employers trust.",
  "problem_statement": "U.S. healthcare is expensive, rigid, and frustrating for both employees and employers. Traditional employer-sponsored plans are one-size-fits-all, opaque, and burden HR teams with administrative complexity. Employees face delayed care, high out-of-pocket costs, and little control. Vivian flips the model by giving members direct financial resources for routine care, rollover savings, and true insurance for life\u2019s surprises, all supported by a CareConcierge who eliminates friction. This approach improves affordability, member engagement, and trust in employer benefits.",
