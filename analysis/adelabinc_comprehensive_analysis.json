  "description": "Adelab builds BizCrush, an AI-powered In-Person Meeting Agent that records and summarizes offline conversations, drafts personalized follow-up emails, and syncs directly to CRMs like Salesforce and HubSpot\u2014transforming a 30-minute manual process into a 1-minute review to eliminate missed follow-ups and maximize revenue from real-world relationships.",
  "problem_statement": "In-person meetings drive the most valuable deals, yet 80% of event leads are never followed up on and 70% of conversation details vanish within 24 hours. This leakage costs companies over $60K per rep annually. Existing CRMs and AI note takers focus on online interactions, leaving offline workflows broken. BizCrush captures every in-person conversation, generates instant personalized follow-up emails, and syncs them to CRMs\u2014ensuring no opportunity is lost.",
