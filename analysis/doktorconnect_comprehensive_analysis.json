  "problem_statement": "My friend Jim died at the age of 42. Jim had diabetes. This happened because of an autoimmune disease that affected his pancreas and unable to produce insulin that led to a type 1 diabetes, and didn't know it until it was too late. He found out because of a wound he sustained at work that would not heal. At the time of his passing, he was an amputee and severely depressed. He left two daughters and his wife with exciting data about his business and finances, but Jim was not tracking a single data about his health. Since that happened, l vowed that there would not be another Jim. This is the story of 1 out 4 American",
