  "problem_statement": "Small businesses are drowning in administrative complexity—HR, payroll, benefits, compliance. PEOs were designed to help, but the process of finding the right one is broken. It’s opaque, repetitive, and riddled with friction. SMB leaders waste hours filling out redundant intake forms, chasing down incomplete quotes, and making decisions with incomplete data. Many give up, staying with an overpriced, underperforming PEO simply because switching is too painful. That means higher costs, worse benefits, and real risk to their employees.\n\nFor PEOs, it’s no better. They spend enormous time quoting bad-fit deals or chasing leads that ghost them. Junior sales reps drown in intake emails. Close rates suffer. CAC stays high. And the best-fit prospects—the ones they should be winning—often walk away or never get through the intake process. Everyone loses. The inefficiency costs SMBs thousands per year and costs PEOs millions in missed revenue.",
