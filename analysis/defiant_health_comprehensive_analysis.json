  "description": "Defiant Health is building a new front door for cancer care, guiding patients through diagnosis in days, not months, and supporting their most important decisions with expertise and attention at every step.",
  "problem_statement": "Cancer care is beset with delay, error, and excess cost, diminishing patient outcomes and quality-of-life and increasing the burden on payers, employers, and patients who pay for care. We address those problems by engaging patients early - before they are diagnosed - and supporting the critical initial steps in their journey. Our entry point for patient engagement addresses the suffering that patients endure trying to get timely and accurate answers when they suspect they may have cancer. Then, for those who do have a positive diagnosis, we help address the challenge they face in finding the best oncology team for their specific condition and ensure their treatment plan reflects best practice among complex and rapidly evolving treatment options. In total, these interventions not only address patient experience and outcomes, but result in significant cost savings to payers and employers.",
