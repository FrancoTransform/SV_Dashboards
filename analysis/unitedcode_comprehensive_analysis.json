  "description": "UnitedCode is a data-driven, AI-powered platform transforming tech recruitment. Since 2019, we\u2019ve applied advanced analytics to evaluate developers\u2019 skills, career histories, and profiles with unmatched precision. Combined with our proprietary resume format, expert recruiters, and sourcing in 25 countries, we deliver rigorously vetted talent through a fully transparent, flat-fee model.",
  "problem_statement": "We are solving one of the most painful operational problems for scaling tech companies: hiring the right engineers - faster and with unmatched precision. The tech hiring market is at a breaking point. AI is rapidly advancing, and simply \u201cknowing how to code\u201d is no longer enough, projects now demand developers with highly specific, often niche, real-world experience that AI cannot replicate. Competition for these specialists has already begun, with global tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia preparing talent pipelines years in advance. The number of technologies, frameworks, and versions is exploding, making it impossible for even the most seasoned recruiters to accurately classify and match skills to project needs. The outdated resume format, unchanged for decades, fails to capture the depth, relevance, and evolution of a developer\u2019s expertise. It works for filtering entry-level or non-technical candidates, but breaks entirely when assessing high-caliber engineers in an AI-driven world. Left unaddressed, this problem will intensify: demand for specialized talent will far outstrip supply, hiring costs will soar, mismatches will become more frequent, and companies will lose valuable time, money, and market opportunities.",
