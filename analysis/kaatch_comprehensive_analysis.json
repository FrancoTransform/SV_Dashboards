  "description": "Kaatch helps fast-growing companies access vetted, senior HR experts, on demand. We offer flexible, project-based support across talent, people ops, compliance, and culture, without the rigidity of agencies or the noise of marketplaces. Our model is curated, human-first, and built for startups and scaleups that treat HR as strategic.",
  "problem_statement": "Startups and scaleups face urgent HR challenges: hiring, retention, compliance, culture but often lack the internal capacity or expertise to solve them. Traditional solutions like agencies or full-time hires are slow, rigid, or too expensive. We know that people decisions are business decisions and too many fast-growing companies get them wrong when they can’t access the right expertise in time.",
