  "description": "RituWell is a B2B digital wellness platform that empowers organizations to drive tailored well-being initiatives and achieve sustained health outcomes. We partner with forward-thinking employers, health plans and health systems to set a new standard for holistic and preventative care, reducing healthcare expenses and improving productivity and retention. RituWell is the first truly integrated platform offering a dedicated infrastructure for optimal performance, privacy and engagement.",
  "problem_statement": "Employers are seeing soaring healthcare spending, and physically and mentally unhealthy employees while our heath plans continue to focus on reactive rather than preventative care. Retention is at its lowest in 10 years, with $322 billion lost annually in turnover and productivity from employee burnout alone. 1 in 4 remote workers is also reporting loneliness which is having further devastating effects on physical and mental health.",

Benefits leaders are experience point-solution fatigue with very low engagement and awareness. They are looking for an integrated, digital-first solution that offers a one-contract buying solution and can be tailored for their specific population needs, whether it be demographics, culture, risk areas, etc.\nIn-market since: Yes, about 4 months"

      "justification": "Traction: We finished building our B2B platform, broadened beyond an initial fitness focus to include mental wellness, MSK, Women's Health and more by signing more than 50 wellness supplier contracts. We've professionally produced more than 1,000 videos and created high demand condition-specific programs. We're now ready to GTM and built out our buy-side through employers and health plans and have built over $750k in initial pipeline deals with blue chip names like CVS Health, Cigna/Evernorth and more. We also have excellent, proven engagement stats for our platform.\nCustomers: We have one pilot implemented with a lot of customers in late stage deal cycles, about $750k. Our average annual contract size is just above $100k. We are just approaching the buying season for our industry and are focused on direct sales as well as building out a robust distribution network through the consultants and brokers.\nPricing: We have about $100k in annual revenue right now but not all from the new model, which is a simple PEPM."

    "The decision to pivot from our initial consumer model was brought about from learning about the convergence of the fitness/wellness industry and the healthcare industry, in part driven by value-based care adoption. McKinsey released a great report that talks about the key to unlocking meaningful health outcomes lying with the employers and the workplace. I firmly believe that integrated, preventative well-being is the future of the workplace and beyond."
