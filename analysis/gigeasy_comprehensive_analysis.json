  "description": "GigEasy is an AI-powered insurance marketplace helping carriers and brokers efficiently sell small business and contractor insurance.",
  "problem_statement": "Carriers have developed insurance products for contractors and small businesses, but many sit unused due to limited distribution. Brokers lack the tools to efficiently place these policies, and SMBs struggle to access coverage. For contractors, insurance is often required to work or get paid, directly impacting their revenue. GigEasy connects carriers, brokers, and SMBs through a modern distribution platform that gets the right products into the right hands quickly.",
