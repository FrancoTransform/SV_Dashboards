    "One significant feedback (we heard this multiple times) when we first entered the market last summer was that although customers were happy to be secure with all the tools we offered, they felt like they were missing the proof that any of it worked. We started churning all the free pilots we had set up during the development phases, as potential customers didn't know if it solved their security worries. \n\nWe realized then that customers were seeking to build trust internally and externally and prove to themselves and the world they were secure. We pivoted to vertically integrating the NIST framework and automated policy and audit creation into onboarding. We saw immediate gains in every part of the funnel and realized we were solving their problem, linking security to their revenue, which was much more complex than simple tooling."
