  "description": "Double sided platform for Nonprofits, donors and volunteers. For Nonprofits, we provide a CRM and opportunities with new and existing donors. For endusers, we provide tools for donating, tax tracking, and volunteering. Revenue streams include: Transactions, subscriptions, data collection and more.",
  "problem_statement": "Too many nonprofits rely on outdated systems that drain time, hide insights, and make giving feel impersonal. High fees cut into every donation. Manual processes slow growth. Donors are left in the dark, unsure how their gifts help or why they should give again. This leads to fewer repeat donations, less engagement, and more obstacles standing in the way of impact.",

    "justification": "The founding team consists of two co-founders who have been best friends for over 10 years, indicating strong personal chemistry. However, the team is relatively small with only three engineers and lacks diversity in functional expertise. The co-founders have a shared passion for helping people, but there is limited information on their prior entrepreneurial experience or domain expertise in the nonprofit sector.",

      "business_model_strength": "The business model includes multiple revenue streams such as transactions, subscriptions, and data collection. However, the scalability and competitive positioning are yet to be validated as the company is pre-revenue.",
      "market_positioning": "Cherrygiving aims to differentiate itself by offering a comprehensive platform for nonprofits, donors, and volunteers. The unique value proposition lies in providing a CRM for nonprofits and tools for donors and volunteers, but market differentiation needs further validation.",
      "execution_capability": "The team has not yet launched the product in the market, so execution capability remains unproven. The in-house development team is a positive sign, but scaling operations will require additional resources.",
      "strategic_vision": "The strategic vision is to address inefficiencies in the nonprofit sector, but the long-term vision and market understanding need further articulation."
