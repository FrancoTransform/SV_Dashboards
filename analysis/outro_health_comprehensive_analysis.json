  "description": "The first virtual platform for deprescribing, starting with the 50M Americans on antidepressants. We leverage the first neuroscience-based tapering method, invented by our co-founder.",
  "problem_statement": "We're solving the absence of dedicated deprescribing solutions for several drug classes, used by 100M+ people in the western world. Particularly for psychiatric medications: 10s of millions are using the drugs for longer than guidelines recommend - subject to side effects and long-term effects - and withdrawal symptoms keep them trapped on medications (and drives up healthcare costs). We believe that deprescribing will become a revolutionary category of medicine - a response to the epidemic of overprescribing.",
