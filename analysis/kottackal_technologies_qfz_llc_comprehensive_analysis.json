  "website": "https://www.kottackal.org",
  "year_founded": "2024",
  "description": "We have developed an Energy hub platform called GreenPoint that connects Energy producers with Energy consumers in Energy hubs like smart city, ports or fleets.\n\nGreenPoint provides the below value:\n\n1) Single interface for energy concentration hub manager / owner to operate, manage and plan their facility\n2) Data aggregation for all the energy data that passes through the facility\n\nFor this innovation, we were one of the finalist in the AEMOB Innovation forum, Qatar. We are also piloting the platform with Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar.",
  "problem_statement": "Today, the energy - mobility sector requires a prior trust relationship before any services could be availed. For example, for charging, the user needs prior registration and approval by the service providers.\n\nFurther the data is siloed and stored with the respective service provider.\n\nThis means that the facility manager of an energy concentration hub like smart city or port would need to access the indivitual applications to access the data. \n\nThis is cumbersome and inefficient.\n\nGreenPoint aggregates energy data across platform and provides a single interface for the facility manager.",

    "score": 3,
    "justification": "The team is currently led by a single founder, Jacob Ninan, who has developed the GreenPoint platform in-house. While the founder has demonstrated technical capability and innovation, the lack of a co-founding team with complementary skills could be a limitation in scaling the business.",
    "company_assessment": {
      "business_model_strength": "The business model is B2B, charging fees based on cost savings for customers. This model aligns with industry practices but lacks clarity on pricing structure and scalability.",
      "market_positioning": "The company positions itself as a data aggregator for energy hubs, offering a unique value proposition in simplifying data access for facility managers.",
      "execution_capability": "The team has successfully developed and piloted the platform, indicating execution capability. However, scaling operations with a small team could be challenging.",
      "strategic_vision": "The strategic vision is focused on leveraging data analytics for future AI use-cases, which is forward-thinking but requires further validation and market fit."
