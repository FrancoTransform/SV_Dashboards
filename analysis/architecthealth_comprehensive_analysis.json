  "description": "Architect Health is an AI-powered vendor management system for payers. Architect solves the vendor fragmentation and point-solution fatigue challenges for payers and brokers by centralizing the entire procurement process for digital health. The Architect operating system evaluates telehealth vendors, automates RFPs, negotiates contracts, tracks performance, and optimizes spend for payers.",
  "problem_statement": "The healthcare industry faces a critical challenge: vendor management. Payers struggle with fragmented, siloed markets containing hundreds of unique vendors, resulting in inefficient\u2014sometimes nonexistent\u2014procurement processes. The manual procurement processes are overwhelmed, creating a bottleneck of 12\u201336 month procurement cycles and preventing efficient adoption of high-quality telehealth. Ultimately, this leads to low member engagement, unclear ROI, and point-solution fatigue. Telehealth exemplifies this vendor fatigue in healthcare. Despite its proven benefits\u2014affordability, convenience, and growing clinical evidence\u2014the telehealth market remains highly fragmented. This fragmentation, combined with payers' manual procurement processes, intensifies the vendor management problem, creating our strategic entry point into the market. Architect Health tackles this challenge directly as an AI-powered vendor management system for payers. Our platform streamlines vendor evaluation by simplifying assessment, automating procurement, and establishing measurable vendor ROI.",
