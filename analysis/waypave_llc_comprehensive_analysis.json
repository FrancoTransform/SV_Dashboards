  "description": "WayPave is an hourly hiring platform using patent-pending swipe-to-match technology to connect local, qualified candidates with employers across industries. Our matching platform empowers businesses to build high-performing teams while giving hourly job seekers opportunity in real-time.",
  "problem_statement": "WayPave solves the inefficiency and inequity in hourly hiring. Traditional job boards overwhelm employers with unqualified applicants and leave job seekers in the dark about pay, schedule, fit, or next steps. This matters because over 80 million Americans work hourly jobs, yet the hiring process is slow, biased, and broken, which hurts both businesses and people. WayPave drives economic mobility and allows job seekers to make better financial decisions for themselves and their families.",
