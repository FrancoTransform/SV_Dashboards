  "description": "SupportPay is pioneering Modern Family Finances, helping families split, track, and manage shared expenses, payments, schedules, and communications across households. We end money conflicts, improve relationships, and boost productivity through a secure, certified, and easy-to-use platform for consumers and as a measurable, ROI-driven employee benefit.",
  "problem_statement": "Families today are financially interdependent, but are forced to manage shared finances using spreadsheets, texts, Venmo, email, and arguments. It\u2019s a time-consuming, emotionally draining process that creates stress, erodes trust, and leads to lost productivity. SupportPay solves this by automating the process, storing everything in one place, and creating certified records. It matters because financial stress is the #1 cause of family conflict, and it\u2019s killing focus, well-being, and workplace performance.",
