  "description": "Bluespine is an AI-powered pre/post-payment integrity platform that empowers employers and carriers/TPAs to reduce FWA in healthcare through the discovery and prevention of medical and pharmaceutical overbilling. It detects overbilling by generating employer or provider-specific rulesets, enabling a customizable claims review process that yields evidence-based results.",
  "problem_statement": "Employers face significant fiduciary and regulatory risks due to overbilling errors in medical and pharmaceutical claims. Without robust pre-payment review solutions, they struggle to prevent unnecessary healthcare spending and face exposure to ERISA violations. Bluespine's AI-powered platform addresses these challenges by applying employer-specific rulesets to claims, ensuring cost containment and regulatory compliance. For carriers, Bluespine reduces FWA-related losses and operational costs by enabling customizable, provider-specific rulesets and conducting automated, evidence-based reviews of claims.",
