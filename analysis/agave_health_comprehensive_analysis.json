  "description": "Agave Health is building the care infrastructure for a neurodivergent world - starting with ADHD. Our AI-enabled platform delivers evidence-based, continuous care designed for how neurodivergent brains work, improving outcomes, reducing costs, and unlocking performance and wellbeing across the modern workforce",
  "problem_statement": "Agave addresses the critical access gap for neurodiverse adults, starting with ADHD. Most solutions today are fragmented, lack clinical rigor, and aren’t covered by insurance. EAPs, in particular, are not designed for specialized, ongoing care for neurodevelopmental conditions. Access to generalist therapists or coaches is insufficient for this population. Neurodevelopmental conditions are not episodic - they require ongoing, multi-modal care. Without proper intervention, neurodiverse individuals and their families face compounding challenges that affect workplace productivity, mental health, and retention. Our integrated care model ensures individuals, caregivers, spouses, and managers receive tailored support - delivering better outcomes and lower costs for employers and payors. As neurodivergence becomes mainstream, solving this isn’t niche - it’s the future of behavioral health.",
