  "description": "JOGO Health, backed by Mayo Clinic, provides FDA-cleared digital treatments for migraine and neurological conditions, delivered virtually and through our nationwide partner clinics. Our solutions help employers reduce the total cost of care, improve employee health outcomes, and address access challenges — enhancing workforce productivity and retention.",
  "problem_statement": "JOGO Health addresses two major healthcare gaps affecting employees and healthcare costs:\n\nFaster Access to Neurological Care:\nNearly 50% of employees suffer from at least one neurological condition, yet the average wait time to see a neurologist in the U.S. is over six months. JOGO Health offers virtual neurology consults within 24 hours across all 50 states — improving employee access, reducing absenteeism, and preventing costly disease progression.\n\nCost-Effective Alternative to High-Cost Treatments:\nEMG Biofeedback is recognized as a medical necessity to reduce reliance on Botox, CGRP-inhibitors, and neuromodulation surgeries for migraines and neurological disorders. However, it’s traditionally available only at large academic medical centers. JOGO provides the only FDA-cleared virtual EMG Biofeedback system deliverable via telemedicine — making it easily accessible to your employees wherever they are.\n\nImpact:\nEmployees who receive JOGO’s virtual neurology consults combined with EMG Biofeedback significantly reduce their use of high-cost medications and invasive procedures — helping employers lower healthcare spend while improving employee well-being and retention.",
