  "description": "chainstaff is a referral-powered hiring platform that helps companies fill roles faster by activating internal and external networks. Jobs are shared with bounties, and rewards are distributed to active participants. No upfront cost, fully automated, and infinitely scalable - turning every person into a recruiter.",
  "problem_statement": "Hiring is broken: it’s expensive, slow, and relies on outdated systems. While referrals consistently deliver the best candidates, they are limited to employees, hard to manage, and impossible to scale.\n\nchainstaff changes that. We transform the referral process into an open, incentivized, and fully automated system - enabling anyone, not just employees, to share jobs and earn rewards when hires are made. This unlocks entirely new distribution channels for companies: alumni, freelancers, industry experts, and niche communities become your extended recruiting force.\n\nWith zero upfront cost and clear ROI on every hire, chainstaff turns network-based hiring into a scalable engine for growth. We’re not just improving referrals, we’re building the infrastructure for open, performance-based recruiting.",
