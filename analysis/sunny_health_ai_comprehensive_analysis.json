  "problem_statement": "Healthcare navigation is broken. Most people don’t know how to find in-network care, what’s covered, or where to go when they need help, resulting in delayed treatment, unnecessary ER visits, and billions in wasted claims. Despite employers and payers spending heavily on benefits, usage is low because the experience is fragmented, slow, and confusing.\n\nSunny Health solves this with an AI-powered concierge that understands your health plan, finds the right providers, checks eligibility in real-time, and books appointments, all through a simple embeddable chat. No apps. No hold times. No guesswork.\n\nThis matters because the current healthcare navigation isn’t just frustrating, it’s costly. It leads to worse outcomes for patients and higher spend for employers and insurers. Our solution increases benefits utilization, improves time-to-care by 60%, and reduces avoidable claims, unlocking ROI for all stakeholders.",
