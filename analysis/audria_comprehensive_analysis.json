  "description": "Audria is a gentle AI companion platform for people living with dementia, their family members, and caregivers. It uses familiar voices, personal memories, and daily prompts to ease loneliness and support connection. Audria also provides helpful insights, giving families and care teams extra peace of mind and practical help every day.",
  "problem_statement": "The Problem We’re Solving: People living with dementia often feel lonely and disconnected, which increases anxiety and speeds decline. Families and caregivers struggle to stay connected and coordinated, often relying on medication to manage distress that could be eased with more daily support. Why It Matters: Loneliness can be as harmful as a chronic disease. Better connection and gentle daily interaction help reduce unnecessary medication use, improve well-being, and lighten the burden on families and care teams. By bridging gaps in family coordination and providing consistent, comforting interaction, Audria helps people feel heard and cared for every day.",
