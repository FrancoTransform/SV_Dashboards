  "description": "Peer-to-peer rental marketplace for heavy machinery equipment",
  "problem_statement": "Equipment owners struggle to rent out their heavy machinery while general contractors have a hard time finding the equipment they need seamlessly without having to negotiate prices. Additionally, there's no way for either to know if they're trustworthy. That's why we're facilitating that connection and enabling ratings functionalities in addition to individual authentication. Combined, this becomes an incredibly time consuming process where both parties are losing out on revenue and suffering because of the lack of accountability in the industry.",
