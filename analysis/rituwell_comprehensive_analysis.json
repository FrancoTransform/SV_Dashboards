RituWell is the first truly integrated platform offering a dedicated infrastructure for optimal performance, privacy and engagement.",
  "problem_statement": "Employers are seeing soaring healthcare spending, and physically and mentally unhealthy employees while our health plans continue to focus on reactive rather than preventative care. Retention is at its lowest in 10 years, with $322 billion lost annually in turnover and productivity from employee burnout alone. 1 in 4 remote workers is also reporting loneliness which is having further devastating effects on physical and mental health.",
