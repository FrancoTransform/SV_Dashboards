  "description": "OneRange is an AI-powered people development platform and global learning marketplace that connects employees with the most relevant, high-impact resources, aligning individual goals with company skill strategies. We combine AI personalization, advanced budget controls, and measurable ROI to transform corporate learning into a driver of internal mobility, retention, and growth.",
  "problem_statement": "Corporate learning is broken. Despite spending an average of $1,600 per employee annually, companies see low engagement, poor relevance, and little measurable ROI. Traditional LMS platforms push generic content that fails to meet the evolving demands of a workforce facing historic skills gaps, AI-driven job disruption, and a growing need for continuous upskilling. Employees are frustrated by the inability to access the best resources, HR leaders lack visibility into ROI, and budgets are wasted on underused tools. With 94% of employees stating they would stay longer if given better growth opportunities, solving this problem directly impacts retention, performance, and competitiveness. OneRange addresses these issues by curating the world\u2019s best learning resources through our Infinite Marketplace, leveraging AI for personalized recommendations and skills tagging, enabling seamless approvals, and offering a flexible pay-per-use model so companies only pay for what\u2019s used. The result is an engaged workforce, targeted skill development, and a direct link between learning investments and business outcomes.",
