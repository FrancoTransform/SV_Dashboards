  "description": "Toothsome is building the future of dental benefits through direct employer-provider contracting. By eliminating insurance friction (prior authorizations, claim denials, annual caps) our platform lets patients use benefits like cash at the point of care, driving utilization of preventive treatments that reduce employer medical spend by 12%.",
  "problem_statement": "Dental \"insurance\" isn't actually insurance, it's an annual stipend with asterisks, a fixed benefit with guardrails and blockers designed to prevent accessing care. With $1,500 annual caps unchanged since the 1960s, it covers cleanings but fails on procedures that make an impact on overall systemic health. Meanwhile, untreated periodontal disease costs employers $1,824 per diabetic employee annually in excess medical claims. We're solving this by creating enabling medical-dental integration through direct contracting. Our bundled periodontal treatments for diabetics reduce HbA1c by 0.38% (76% as effective as metformin), delivering immediate medical savings. Employers see 52% ROI Year 1, providers earn 35-50% more than PPO rates with guaranteed payment, and patients get care that actually prevents $50,000 ICU stays. This matters because oral health drives systemic health, yet our healthcare system historically has treated them separately, wasting $50B annually in unused, paid-for dental benefits, while 42% of adults live with untreated periodontal disease.",
