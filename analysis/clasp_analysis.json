  "description": "Clasp is the all-in-one platform that automates benefits administration for brokers and HR platforms. Our AI benefit engine simplifies quoting, enrollment, carrier integrations, and back-office tasks\u2014allowing brokers to run their business more efficiently and focus on growth.",
  "problem_statement": "Small group health is becoming less profitable for brokers due to rising premiums, lower enrollment rates, and increased administrative complexity (ancillaries, level-funded, ICHRA, etc.) \n\nEvery broker serving this segment is desperately looking for ways to drive down their operational overhead. Group build, managing carrier connections, and payroll integrations are the most common bottlenecks for brokers that Clasp aims to entirely automate.",
