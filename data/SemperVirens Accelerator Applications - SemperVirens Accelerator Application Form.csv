GTMFlow,2021,"GTMFlow equips executives and organizations with the mindset and tools to thrive through curveballs—unexpected challenges that disrupt performance. Our executive cancer coaching is a scalable benefit that supports employees navigating diagnosis or caregiving, helping them balance work, treatment, and communication to stay resilient and productive.",https://www.gtmflow.com,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16-PULH2wlOu-TV7iXXNWDfsUxQ9LxWnSbY3ShOPpols/edit?usp=sharing,https://share.descript.com/view/4zU8JcMWofj,"A cancer diagnosis is profoundly destabilizing—especially for executives responsible for leading teams, driving strategy, and managing critical customer and investor relationships. These leaders are expected to deliver clarity, momentum, and stability—while suddenly navigating medical decisions, emotional strain, and physical disruption. Most employers offer insurance and clinical support, but they lack real-time, experienced, executive-centric coaching to help executives process the diagnosis, communicate with stakeholders, and balance their dual responsibilities to their health and their company.

Without targeted support, executives often withdraw, make reactive decisions, or disappear from the business when their leadership is most needed. This creates ripple effects across teams and priorities, leading to unnecessary leaves, stalled initiatives, and cultural instability. GTMFlow closes this gap by delivering executive-grade coaching that helps leaders develop a plan, communicate confidently, and stay engaged—so they can protect their health and business continuity.","Joelle Kaufman, Founder & CEO
https://www.linkedin.com/in/joellekaufman/","All coaching content and delivery tools are developed in-house by the founder, based on a proprietary coaching method and lived experience. No external developers involved although we leverage GenAI platforms such as ChatGPT, NotebookLM, and Anthropic.","1 – Solopreneur (Founder-led: coaching delivery, operations, go-to-market).

This product is at the conceptual, pre-launch process. With demand, we have a pipeline of prospective coaches (former executives who have faced cancer) who will be trained in the approach and scale the delivery of the service. 

We are also in discussions with OpenNetworks.org to offer our service through their platform where the platform will trigger notification of a qualified individual with a cancer diagnosis so that private contact can be made within the first 48 hours of diagnosis.",N/A,No - we've been testing the needs and packaging with inbound referrals (2-3 per week),"Mid-size to large companies (50–5,000+ employees) that want to offer a modern, meaningful benefit to support executives facing cancer and provide business continuity and excellent guidance. Their most significant pain point: lack of proactive, human-centered support for navigating work and treatment, resulting in presenteeism, burnout, and attrition.",Over 2 million U.S. cancer diagnoses each year; 46% are working adults. Employers with 50+ employees represent over 100 million covered lives. We estimate our SAM at $3B for cancer-specific coaching benefits.,"Well-being apps, EAPs, and navigation platforms (e.g. Spring Health, Included Health) address mental or clinical support but don’t provide practical, confidential coaching for how to stay engaged at work post-diagnosis. They miss the first 48–72 hours—when employees most need support planning what to say, how to manage expectations, and how to show up at work.","We operate as an employee benefit provider. Employers pay a low monthly per-employee-per-month (PEPM) fee. There are different rates if you want the benefit accessible to all employees—not just executives—when they or someone they care for is diagnosed with cancer. Employees activate the benefit confidentially and receive 1:1 coaching, communication planning, decision support, and access to tools that help them stay engaged and healthy through treatment.","Strong evidence of need and that the support within the first 4 weeks is the crucial period for these individuals to communicate, set expectations, and manage work and health responsibilities.",N/A,N/A,"Sales cycle is 45–90 days. Decision-makers include People/HR leaders, Total Rewards leaders, and occasionally CFOs or founders. Cancer support is often an emotional and strategic decision, requiring education and real-world framing.  Our best prospects are executives who themselves have navigated a cancer journey and recognize the immediacy and disruption it causes.","Growing demand for targeted benefits and inclusive support programs. Post-pandemic benefits trends emphasize mental health, chronic care, and employee advocacy. Cancer impacts 1 in 2 families—HR leaders are actively seeking scalable solutions with a personal, human touch. We’ve received strong endorsements from oncologists, patient advocates, and benefits leaders.",Self-funded.

The stress of navigating perceptions, expectations, and potential marginalization at work often outweighs the medical fear in those early days.

This insight helped me realize that communication isn’t just a tactical issue—it’s an emotional lifeline. I pivoted GTMFlow to address not only decision-making and productivity, but also the deep need for guidance around disclosure, relationship dynamics, and workplace identity after a diagnosis. Our coaching now starts by helping clients build a communication plan rooted in clarity, confidence, and compassion—because the moment they share their diagnosis often defines how supported (or isolated) they’ll feel going forward.",Jed Cloern referred me,Jed Cloern,,4/17/25 18:45,ez629t5di74w8p2ez62xvx5zd22bwicf
